      "Original Text: LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

       "[{'article': \"Bernie Ecclestone has urged Formula One's teams to start making sacrifices in a bid to save the sport from completely imploding. Ecclestone's words of warning come at the end of a miserable period for F1, notably with Caterham and Marussia entering administration. With costs spiralling out of control, and with the FIA powerless to act, three other cash-strapped teams in Lotus, Force India and Sauber have threatened to boycott the United States Grand Prix as a protest at what they perceive as a lack of action to stop the folly. Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone says he is to blame for problems afflicting some of the smaller teams . Ecclestone, however, has dismissed that prospect out of hand. 'Forget all that c**p,' the F1 chief said. 'I promise they will be racing. 'They will be racing, I give you a guarantee - but I worry if they will be racing next year.' Therein lies Ecclestone's major problem - one which has surprisingly led him to concede that 'I know what's wrong, but don't know how to fix it'. Ecclestone added: 'No-one is prepared to do anything about it because they can't. The regulations have tied us up. 'If we were in a position where we could help these teams in trouble, we would do it. But we are not allowed to. Lotus are one of three teams who have threatened to boycott the United States Grand Prix . 'If one team is given 10,000 (US dollars), everyone has to have 10,000. The trouble with lots of regulations and lots of contracts is we don't think long term.' Part of the problem is the contracts Ecclestone has negotiated over the years with the teams, which includes the distribution of revenues. The smaller marques are dismayed at how the likes of Ferrari, Red Bull, McLaren and Mercedes overwhelmingly receive the lion's share of the £900 million handed out. Ecclestone added: 'It makes no difference to me how the money is shared out. 'If they sat down here with me now and said they want to share out all of the money they get in a different way, I would say, 'Good, give me the bit of paper'. 'The problem is there is too much money being distributed badly - probably my fault - but, like lots of agreements people make, they seemed a good idea at the time.' Another issue Ecclestone faces is the teams now have too much say in the regulations, and, given so many vested interests, there is a lack of agreement. British-based Sauber are fuming at not having a say in the running of the sport . Ecclestone has a solution, but knows what the outcome would be. 'I would say to people getting a chunk of money that I would like to take a percentage of their performance-related payment,' Ecclestone said. 'I would put that money together to divide among the three or four we know are in trouble, and then I would put in the same amount of money. 'But there would not be one team that would think it was a bloody good idea. 'In the old days, the people sitting around a table would be the guys who could say yes or no. They would ask me to sort it out and it would be sorted. 'But none of the modern guys can agree anything, even if they wanted to. They all have to report back to somebody.' Although Ecclestone is effectively known as the commercial rights holder, it is private equity firm CVC Capital Partners which runs the sport - much to the apparent dismay of the teams. With Ecclestone no longer the man in overall charge, he said: 'If the company belonged to me, I would have done things in a different way. Smaller teams like\\xa0Force India\\xa0are struggling to make ends meet . 'That's because it would have been my money I was dealing with, but I work for people who are in the business to make money.' Another option for Ecclestone is to 'tear up all the contracts'. He added: 'I'd take all the money, pay all the teams' debts that should be paid so people haven't suffered because of Formula One, and people haven't got credit for Formula One. 'I'd then say this is what you are going to get next year, this is the amount of money we've got, and this is what is going to happen from now on in. It's percentages.' The bottom line for Ecclestone is the big teams have to yield. 'It's not the biggest crisis I've dealt with, but I'm not happy,' he said. 'It's just you are talking about larger amounts of money, so therefore it is more difficult to solve. 'We'll have to do something about it because we can't all sit back nicely, relaxed and think the problem will go away. 'It's not like having the flu and taking a few tablets and it will disappear. 'The situation is such that if enough people want it resolved, we can resolve it. 'It's a case that the people involved in the sport will have to want to look after the sport and be prepared to make some sacrifices.'\",\n",

Scroll down for video . Named Archicebus achilles and smaller than the pygmy mouse lemur, the tiniest living primate, it was unearthed near the Yangtze River in central China. Even though it weighed under an ounce, the minute animal provides a vital missing link in human evolution . Researchers say the new skeleton, which . is described in the journal Nature, supports the more recent view that . Asia was the continent of origin for primates, not Africa as previously . believed. Small eye sockets reveal it was active by day. Paleontologist . Dr Xijun Ni, who led the research, said: 'This region would have been a . large series of lakes, surrounded by lush tropical forests during the . early Eocene. 'Our analysis shows this new primate was very small and would have weighed less than an ounce. 'It had slender limbs and a long tail, would have been an excellent . arboreal leaper, active during the daytime, and mainly fed on insects.' Closest living relatives: the tarsier (L) is considered endangered and only found on islands in South East Asia; the pygmy mouse lemur is the tiniest living primate and is found on the island of Madagascar .

'Archicebus differs radically from any other primate, . living or fossil, known to science and represents a big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution' Dr Christopher Beard . 'It looks like an odd hybrid with the feet of a small monkey, the arms, legs and teeth of a very primitive primate, and a primitive skull bearing surprisingly small eyes. 'It will force us to rewrite how the anthropoid lineage evolved.' The skeleton was digitally reconstructed using state of the art scanning techniques, allowing to establish the fossil was radically different from any other primate, living or extinct. Anthropologist Dr Dan Gebo, of Northern Illinois University, said: 'This is the oldest primate skeleton of this quality and completeness ever discovered and one of the most primitive primate fossils ever documented. 'The origin of primates sets the first milestone for all primate lineages, including that of humanity. 'Although scientists have found primate teeth, jaws, occasionally skulls or a few limb bones from this time period, none of this evidence is as complete as this new skeleton from China. 'With completeness comes more information and better evidence for the adaptive and evolutionary themes concerning primate evolution. It takes guessing out of the game.' Dr Ni, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, first came across the fossil years ago while doing fieldwork. It had been found by a local farmer and was later donated to the university. It was encased within a rock that was split open to reveal fossils and impressions of the primate on each side of the two halves. The quarry where it was discovered was once a lake where many ancient fish and bird fossils from the same era known geologically as the Eocene have been dug up. Dr Ni said: 'Archicebus marks the first time we have a reasonably complete picture of a primate close to the divergence between tarsiers and anthropoids (primates that include monkeys, apes and humans). 'It represents a big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution.' Their study included a three dimensional, high resolution reconstruction, aided by high tech scanning of the fossil at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France.\",\n",

Pat Taccetta, 52, sobbed as she declared ‘justice will be done’ following the horrific cold-blood killing of her ‘happy’ daughter and three others in Medford on Long Island, New York, on Sunday morning. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Jaime Taccetta, left, was shot in the head and discovered by her fiancé James Manzella after he dropped her off at the pharmacy in Medford on Long Island, New York . Her emotional comments came as police . said they are still searching for the suspect caught on CCTV tape and . consider him an ‘armed and dangerous’ drug user. ‘He was so senseless,’ Mrs Taccetta . told the New York Daily News. ‘He could have stolen the drugs and left . everybody alone.

Her family broke news of the death to her when she arrived home from a . holiday in Jamaica. Meanwhile, Miss Taccetta's fiancé has spoken of how he discovered his . girlfriend's corpse. James Manzella went to check on 'the love of his life' Miss Taccetta, after dropping her off at Haven Drugs in Long Island. Incredibly, . Mr Manzella only went to check on Jamie after seeing the bearded killer . leave the pharmacy and calmly walk away from the scene. Speaking to the New York Post, Mr . Manzella said: 'I saw the guy walk out, and I thought something was weird. 'So I turned the car off to check on her [Jamie]. I walked to the front.' He then stumbled upon the horrific scenes inside the store, finding Jamie as well as a second victim Bryon Sheffield, 71, dead. 'Can you imagine sitting there in air conditioning, . listening to music, and then the next minute she's gone,' he said. 'It was horrible, man. It was something I'll never forget. I'll never forget what I saw. It's stuck in me.' Mr Manzella, an electrician, planned to marry physical therapist Miss Taccetta in October. She had two daughters - Miranda, 16, and Kaitlyn, 5. A distraught Mr Manzella said he was haunted by the fact he saw the killer moments after the shooting took place. Junkie: These images, taken from the security camera at the Haven Pharmacy, appear to show the gunman perusing the shelves for drugs . He added: 'I could see the guy clearly, and now I think back if I could have done something. 'That's what messes with you. We were two average people trying to do the right thing, and this is what happens. It's not fair.' It has also emerged that the ruthless . gunman was . hunting for prescription painkillers. In what is thought be the latest in a string of drug fuelled robberies, the killer stormed the family-owned Haven Drugs pharmacy looking for the painkillers, according to police. A massive manhunt for the killer is continuing after Suffolk County homicide . detectives found the bodies at about . 60 miles east of New York City. Shot dead: Jennifer Mejia, who worked at the pharmacy in Medford, Long Island . Shock: The owner of a Pharmacy in Medford, NY collapses when he arrives at the store, following a shooting that killed four people. A pharmacist, a teenage worker, and two customers were killed when the gunman opened fire inside the store at roughly 10am. CCTV footage shows the gunman shooting at close range, before filling his backpack with prescription painkillers. The killing comes as DEA agents have been calling on Long Island pharmacists to boost security after recording a 125 per cent increase in pharmacy hold-ups in 2009 and 2010. Addicts and dealers are so desperate to get their hands on the painkillers they often leave money behind during the raids as they hunt for more drugs. A teenage girl, just days from graduating high school, has been identified as 17-year-old Jennifer Mejia, a senior at Bellport High School in . Brookhaven. Her father, Rene Mejia - an immigrant from El Salvador - described her as a 'wonderful daughter'. She had worked . at the pharmacy for about two years and wished him a happy Father's Day . early Sunday morning as she left for work. Speaking to the New York Post Rene said: 'This morning she told me, 'Happy Father's Day.' 'She was in a hurry to go to work. 'I held her and said, 'It's okay,' because in my country, Father's Day is Friday. I feel better because I held her.' Other victims were reported to be Raymond Ferguson, 45 - who also worked at the store - . as well as customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, a grandfather. Rene, . speaking outside their home, said his daughter was looking forward to . her prom on Wednesday. 'Now I just see the dress inside,' he said. 'You have to remember all of the good things.' His other daughter Leslie, was also supposed to work at the store that day. 'They were supposed to work today, her and my younger daughter. Leslie didn't go to work today,' he said. The 30-year-old drugstore had been robbed before, according to Mr Mejia. He added that despite this, his daughter was not afraid. Speaking to the Post, he added: 'She said people would come in and demand prescription medicine sometimes. People wanted the strong stuff. 'This was a heavy-duty pharmacy, not like Duane Reade.' Innocent beauty: Jennifer Mejia was among the four slaughtered in the suspected robbery on Sunday . Hunted: Surveillance video of the man that police suspect of shooting and killing four people at a pharmacy . Emotional: This picture, taken from her Facebook tribute page, shows a happy Miss Mejia (Centre) with friends . Kimberly Jimenez, 18, a friend and classmate, said Miss Mejia's 'ambition was to help people.' 'She was never a troubled person. For this to happen, it's so random. Crazy - crazy.' Shaken . residents converged on the crime scene and described the pharmacy as a . mom-and-pop shop where employees knew people by name. 'They know you, they know who you are,' said Nicole Kaiser, 27. 'This isn't that type of town. I can't believe it.' A special Facebook page set up to remember the slain high school student was flooded with tributes. Jalissa Ware posted: 'R.I.P Jenn ♥ we love youu and miss youu.

Tribute: A small memorial to Miss Mejia is seen on the sidewalk near the pharmacy where the shootings occurred . Brave: Mr Mejia said the drugstore had been robbed before . A 911 . emergency call was placed from the store's parking lot and when police arrived they found bodies inside. The drug store's owner Vinoda Kudchadkar arrived after the shooting but fainted when he discovered the scene of carnage inside . He was taken to the hospital. Speaking to the Post, neighbour Dr. Edgar Barrero said: 'He's had heart problems before. He must be devastated.' Popular: Miss Mejia poses with another friend . Hunt: Police are looking for the gunman, who is still at large . Gunned down: Police received a 911 call from the parking lot behind the pharmacy . Police said they were looking for a lone shooter wearing a baseball cap and backpack who was seen leaving the scene. Suffolk County Chief of Detectives Dominick Varrone said: 'This is a vicious, horrible crime. We are dedicating a great number of resources. Right now, our primary interest is apprehending the individual or individuals involved.' Investigators took a laptop from the drugstore and are searching for surveillance footage that may have captured the suspect.

Daniel Watts, 19, of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was sentenced to 20 months in prison yesterday for killing passenger Shannley Leaver, 15, and driver Ronald Gates, 55, in the head-on crash. Now, the father of the 15-year-old girl has urged young people not to drive 'like idiots' and called for a restriction on the number of passengers young drivers are allowed to carry. Shaun Leaver also criticised the length of the sentence for being too short. Cannabis-smoking teenage driver Daniel Watts has been jailed for killing two in a crash in October 2013 . Passenger Shannley Leaver, 15, was killed following the collision along the A12 at Frostenden, Suffolk . In December, father-to-be Watts admitted causing their deaths by careless driving. The court heard he passed his driving test just 10 months before the fatal collision on October 8 2013. On the day of the collision he decided to go to Ipswich from Great Yarmouth to pick up a car part. Before this journey he had never ventured more than five miles from home in his Citroen Saxo car. He invited Shannley Leaver and two other young people - Brodie Jones and Sam Duffy - to go with him. A witness statement from Brodie Jones revealed they had been smoking cannabis. However, Judge John Devaux said no-one could conclusively prove this had played a part in the crash. Mr Gates was driving southbound with his wife Ann in their Peugeot 106 when Watts, driving on the wrong side of the road, ploughed into their car along the A12 at Frostenden, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, at about 8.30pm. The teenager's car was sent spinning in to the air by the force of the collision and flipped over. Watts was sentenced to 20 months in jail yesterday and also banned from driving for two years . Shannley, who attended Lynn Grove High School in Gorleston, was described by her heartbroken father as 'outgoing, fun-loving and lovely' Mr Gates, of Knodishall, Suffolk, and Shannley both died after suffering multiple injuries, Ipswich Crown Court heard. Watts was airlifted to hospital with a broken foot, shattered pelvis, broken leg and dislocated shoulder. He was treated for five weeks before being allowed home. Mr Gates' wife Ann and the two other passengers in Watts' car also suffered serious injuries. As well as receiving 20 months in prison, Watts was also banned from driving for two years. Simon Gladwell, defending Watts, said he took 'full responsibility' and was 'totally remorseful' for the deaths and injuries he had caused. He said Watts genuinely had no recollection of the collision but a black box in his car for insurance purposes showed he had not been speeding prior to the collision. He said Watts had no previous convictions and his girlfriend was pregnant. Shaun Leaver has urged young people not to drive 'like idiots' and criticised the length of the sentence . Shannley, who attended Lynn Grove High School in Gorleston, was last night described by her heartbroken father as 'outgoing, fun-loving and lovely'. Mr Leaver, of Yarmouth, said there were 'no words to describe the devastating effect' her tragic death had had on their family. Mr Gates’ mother Maureen Gates said that while her son’s death would have a lasting impact on her family, Watts would be released from his sentence after 10 months and could then get on with his life.\",\n",

       " {'article': \"Fallen: Thomas McGraw was awarded a Purple Heart after he was killed in Vietnam and now - decades after it was lost - it will be returned to his family . A Purple Heart awarded to a soldier who was killed in Vietnam in 1966 will be returned to his family on Tuesday - two decades after it vanished and turned up in an elementary school playground. Private First Class Thomas McGraw was awarded the Purple Heart after his death in an ambush in Vietnam on February 1, 1966, while serving in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. He was just 19. His daughter, Robyn DeCuffa, was just a toddler when he died, and when she turned 18, her mother gave her McGraw's Army medals, the flag that had covered his coffin and a photo album from his military service. 'The medal was really all that I did have from my father,' said DeCuffa, now a 51-year-old mother of eight from Cortland in central New York. But years later, the Purple Heart disappeared while she was living outside Syracuse, where her father grew up. She said someone likely stole the medal, but she wouldn't elaborate. 'It was a part of him I could physically hang on to,' she said. 'It was devastating when it was missing.' Then somehow, in the early 1990s, the Purple Heart was found by Jason Galloway on the playground at his Syracuse elementary school. He handed it in to the front office. Although McGraw's name was engraved on the back, apparently no effort was made to return it to its owner. When school ended for the year, the medal was given back to Jason, who brought it home. Karen Galloway, Jason's mother, said the medal mostly sat in a drawer in the kitchen of her family's home in Liverpool. Every now and then, her husband would search the Internet in an effort to locate McGraw and return the medal, but had no luck finding any information. 'We didn't put tons and tons of effort into it,' she said. Then, last Christmas, the now 34-year-old Jason was visiting from Virginia when his wife saw the medal and asked why the family had it since Jason, an Air Force veteran, hadn't been wounded. Reunited: McGraw's daughter Robyn DeCuffa, pictured left, will receive the medal on Tuesday. It was found by Jason Galloway, pictured right, when he was a boy but his family were unable to find its owners . When she learned how it had been found, Jason's wife said it would be 'cool' to find its owner. Weeks later, she called her mother-in-law to say she had seen a local news story on Purple Hearts Reunited, a Vermont-based organization that returns lost or stolen military medals to veterans or their families. Karen Galloway contacted the founder, Zachariah Fike, who traced the medal's origins and located DeCuffa, a manager for Capital Region Off-Track Betting, and her mother Sarah Dallas, who lives in Mexico, New York. 'It almost feels like a miracle that this is being returned,' said DeCuffa, whose second-oldest son is an Army veteran and whose second-oldest daughter is in the Air Force. Award: The medal (file picture) will be returned during a ceremony outside Syracuse, New York on Tuesday . Fike will return the medal to DeCuffa and Dallas during a ceremony being held at the Cavalry Club, a former National Guard camp-turned-golf club in Manlius, outside Syracuse. She plans to display the award in the center of her living room. More than 150 people are expected to attend, including Dallas, the soldier's widow, as well as Galloway and her husband. 'I'm so excited about it,' Galloway said. 'He lost his life and I think that it's really important that it gets back to his family.'\",\n",

       " {'article': \"Ringleader: Jordan Horner, known as Jamal Uddin, pictured arriving at court today where he was one of three men given Asbos banning them from promoting Sharia law for five years . Three religious vigilantes who terrorised innocent members of the public as the self-styled ‘Muslim Patrol’ have been banned from promoting Sharia Law in Britain. Jordan Horner, 20, Royal Barnes, 23, and Ricardo MacFarlane, 26, were jailed for a total of two years and ten months for touring East London harassing people they deemed to be ‘non-believers’. The three men were today also slapped with a five-year Asbo banning them from distributing material about Sharia Law to the public, or even meeting each other. The trio are also banned from associating with controversial preacher Anjem Choudary. Judge Timothy Pontius admitted the order was ‘drastic’ but added: ‘With the public interest in mind and the safety of individual members of the public in particular, it seems to me essential that these orders should be granted to run for that period of time.’ The leader of the gang, white Muslim convert Horner, who has declared he wants Sharia law in the UK, attacked people drinking in the street and demanded: ‘Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol.’ Barnes is a pal of Lee Rigby murderer Michael Adebolajo, and last week admitted making a string of sickening videos celebrating the deadly attack on the soldier in Woolwich. The order comes in the wake of their convictions for the Muslim Patrol attacks carried out in January last year. Prosecutor Kate Wilkinson said: ‘The order is designed to act as a much more effective and long-lasting way of making sure the streets of London are protected.’ Of Horner, she said: ‘This is a man with incredibly deep-rooted manifest beliefs with respect of this particular cause. ‘At every opportunity, he appears to manifest this in an unwelcome manner in terms of members of the public.’ She added: ‘They are affiliated with ALM, also known as Muslims Against Crusades, led by Anjem Choudary, underpinning rallies to introduce Sharia Law which they all manifestly participate in.’ Under the Asbo, the three men are . banned from approaching people in public to promote Sharia Law, or . distributing leaflets for their cause even if they are outside a mosque. They are all banned from being meeting each other, as well as Mr Choudary and Dean Le Page, another leading ALM member. Horner . is additionally banned from having a loud hailer and going to an . educational establishment unless he is a student or a relative of a . student. Barnes is also banned from distributing videos promoting Sharia Law. 'Muslim Patrol': Royal Barnes, left, and Ricardo McFarlane, right, who toured the streets with Horner harassing people they judged to be breaking strict Islamic codes, were also given the same order . The religious vigilante group’s activities were exposed in YouTube where they denigrated women as ‘slags’ and used a megaphone to scream ‘kill the non-believers’ at innocent bystanders. Two victims, Joshua Bilton and Anna Reddiford, were told to stop holding hands by Horner and Barnes as they walked down the street in Bethnal Green, East London. Horner yelled through a megaphone: ‘Let go of each other’s hands. This is a Muslim area!’ In a second incident, on January 6 last year Horner and MacFarlane attacked a group of men drinking in the streets of Shoreditch, east London. They screamed ‘kill the non-believers’ as Horner punched James Forward in the jaw and knocked out Patrick Kavanagh with a sucker punch to the head. A week later on January 13 Horner and Barnes confronted another couple, Clare Coyle and Robert Gray, walking in the street in Stepney, east London. The 23 year-old accused Miss Coyle of dressing inappropriately in a Muslim area and that she would be punished in ‘hell fire’. Horner then started filming the event on his mobile phone and branded Clare Coyle a ‘slag’, to which she countered: ‘This is Great Britain. I can dress how I wish.’ In the video, which was later uploaded on to YouTube, the group can be heard shouting: ‘You need to control this area and forbid people from exposing themselves outside the mosque. ‘Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol. Move away from the mosque. Don’t come back. We don’t respect those who disrespect God.’ The video also includes footage of an injured cyclist after an accident later the same morning. A voice can be heard claiming the accident was a result of people drinking on a Saturday night, adding: ‘We call you to embrace Islam, become Muslim.’ Preacher of hate: The trio are also banned from associating with controversial cleric Anjem Choudary . Choudary today insisted that Horner, McFarlane and Barnes were 'fine, upstanding members of the community' and called the order banning them from speaking to him 'unjust'. 'I have not been convicted of any crimes, even though I do not believe in the law of this land,' he said. 'I am very proud of these people who study with me. I knew them all. They used to attend my lectures. They are fine, upstanding members of the community, of very good character. 'They just wanted to speak out about the evils of alcohol, prostitution, gambling and drugs and support Sharia law. 'The oppressors are being allowed to reign which is why we are suffering these floods. It is divine punishment from God. The government and judges are trying to curtail my influence.' In December last year, Judge Rebecca Poulet QC jailed Horner for 68 weeks, MacFarlane for 12 months, and Barnes for 24 weeks. She told them: ‘One of the many good things about living in Great Britain is the tolerance and respect members of the public generally show to one another’s religious beliefs, his dress or his chosen way of life. ‘When on occasions a person shows their intolerance of another individual whether by aggression or violence and in such a way as to cause real fear to the individual then the law can be invoked to protect that individual. ‘This law would protect you if someone treated you in this way. It is the very same law that now brings you before this court for your conduct. ‘My understanding is that Islam is a peaceful religion and this conduct was unfortunately anything but. ‘You were acting together and very late at night and that conduct in particular frightens people and it frightened them with your aggression.’ Despite receiving the longest sentence of the three, Horner, who has changed his name to Jamal Uddin, has already been released because of time spent in custody waiting for sentencing. The court heard at sentencing that he has a wife and two young children, and has turned his back on drugs due to his ‘religious calling’. Barnes is facing up to six-and-a-half years in prison for making the videos about Lee Rigby, including one where he laughed hysterically while driving past the scene of the murder. The Asbo will take effect from today even though he is likely to remain prison for at least two years. Horner, of Walthamstow, east London, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour. He was also jailed for six weeks in July last year for beating up a photographer and causing £3,000 of damage to a car in an attack in Walthamstow, east London. McFarlane, also of Walthamstow, east London, whose real name is Ricardo Langaigne pleaded guilty to affray, and has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street. Barnes, of Hackney, east London, admitted two counts of using threatening words and behaviour, and has previous convictions for theft and handling stolen goods prior his conversion to Islam and also for using threatening words and behaviour on April 2012.\",\n",

       " {'article': \"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:10 EST, 2 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:46 EST, 2 February 2013 . Jailed: Convicted murder Steven L. Robbins, 44, has been captured after a clerical error mistakenly released him from a Chicago courtroom last week . A convicted murder mistakenly released in Chicago because of ‘clerical error’ has been recaptured after spending a week on the run. Steven L. Robbins, 44, was rearrested on late Friday night in Kankakee, about 60 miles south of Chicago, the Cook County Sheriff's Department said after mistakenly given civilian clothes and sent on his way. Illinois officials acknowledged he was able to escape because they lost paperwork directing them to return him to Indiana after his court appearance. Although the details of his capture weren't immediately released though was said to have happened without incident, officials said they used various leads and interviews with friends and family members at police headquarters to locate him. Robbins was serving a 60-year sentence for murder in Indiana and was escorted by Cook County sheriff's deputies to Chicago this week for a court appearance in a separate case involving drug and armed violence charges - a case that had actually been dismissed in 2007. After appearing before two Cook County Circuit Court judges, Robbins was taken to a jail on Chicago's South Side. Captured: Robbins is seen apprehended in Kankakee, Illinois on Friday while wearing civilian clothes, possibly the same ones provided to him mistakenly by officers . He was released hours later, instead of being sent back to Indiana to continue his murder sentence. The public was not alerted that he was on the loose for about 24 hours. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart on Friday took responsibility for Robbins' release, saying a document showing he should be returned to Indiana disappeared while his deputies were transporting the prisoner, sometime between a Tuesday court appearance and his return to jail after a second court appearance Wednesday. Robbins was released on Wednesday evening. ‘We're not ducking the fact we dropped the ball. We made mistakes,’ Dart said. ‘The public deserves much more. We're going to find out what went wrong here.’ But Dart and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, both prominent local Democrats, exchanged tense words about who should accept responsibility for having Robbins brought to Chicago from Indiana. Alvarez said her office had told Dart's office that it didn't need to bring Robbins from Indiana because the drug and armed violence case was closed. But Dart's office proceeded anyway, she said, because of confusion over the outcome of the case and because Robbins demanded to stand trial. Back home: Robbins is heading back to the Indiana Department of Corrections, pictured, after his capture roughly 60 miles south of Chicago on Friday . ‘The Cook County Sherriff's Police, despite the fact that the assistant state's attorney told them that they didn't have to bring him back, they thought it would be better if they did bring him back to get this all cleared up because the guy keeps writing letters demanding trial,’ Alvarez told reporters. But Dart said his office sought - and was granted - permission from the state attorney's office to bring Robbins to Chicago. The sheriff showed The Associated Press a copy of the extradition request from September signed by one of Alvarez's prosecutors. ‘We can't just go to any state in the country and say `You know what? We're going to take someone out of your prison and bring him here.' ... They're the ones that signed off on allowing us to go get this guy,’ Dart said. Dart also said that because of an antiquated computer system, his office thought an arrest warrant for Robbins in the case was still active, which is why it asked the state attorney's office for permission to extradite Robbins. Victim: Robbins was convicted of killing Rutland Melton in 2002 after witnesses say Melton intervened in an argument Robbins was having with a woman at a party . ‘It's our fault but we move 100,000 people a day and it's all done with paper,’ Dart said. Before Robbins was captured, federal and local law enforcement officers knocked on doors in Illinois and Indiana on Friday, including those of his friends and relatives, the sheriff's office said. The FBI and U.S. Marshals Service offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his apprehension. Robbins, a Gary, Ind., native, was serving a sentence for murder and weapons convictions out of Marion County in Indiana. Witnesses to the 2002 killing told police Robbins was arguing with his wife outside a birthday party in Indianapolis when a man intervened, telling Robbins he should not hit a woman, according to court documents. The witnesses said Robbins then retrieved a gun from a car and shot the man, Rutland Melton, in the chest before fleeing. He started serving his sentence in October 2004 and his earliest projected release date was more than 16 years from now, on June 29, 2029. It is not the first time a prisoner has been mistakenly freed from the Cook County Jail. In 2009, Jonathan Cooper, who was serving a 30-year manslaughter sentence in Mississippi, was brought to Chicago to face charges that he failed to register as a sex offender. Prosecutors dropped the charges because, as an inmate, he could not comply with the Sex Offender Registration Act. A clerk reportedly failed to include the Mississippi sentence information in Cooper's file, and jail staff released him. Cooper turned himself in several days later. In a more recent embarrassment for law enforcement officials in Chicago, two convicted bank robbers escaped from a high-rise federal lockup in December by climbing down the side of the building on a rope made of bed sheets and jumping into a cab. Authorities recaptured both men, one of whom remained on the run for about two weeks. Officials have yet to provide a public explanation of the jailbreak.\",\n",

       " {'article': 'London (CNN) -- The bill for staging the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics is set to rise by nearly 20% to £11 billion ($17.2 billion) a UK government committee has warned. The £9.3 billion ($14.5 billion) of public money set aside for funding the Games is \"close to being used up\" according to a report published Friday by the British Parliament\\'s public accounts committee. \"We are concerned about whether the running of the Games will be held within budget. Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around £11 billion,\" said Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the committee. Hodge said that the committee were \"particularly concerned\" with the rise in cost of security for the Games which has doubled from the 2010 estimate of £282 million ($442 million) to over £550 million ($862 million) by December 2011. The London Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) early estimate of a need for 10,000 security guards has now jumped to 23,700. \"It is staggering that the original estimates were so wrong,\" Hodge said. The committee also raised concerns about the Olympic stadium becoming \"a white elephant.\" As yet, no takers have been found for the 80,000-capacity venue which is estimated to have cost nearly £500 million ($785 million) to build. A deal which would have seen West Ham Football Club move into the stadium after the Games collapsed in October 2011. A new tender process opened in December last year with interested parties required to submit full bids by March 23 2012. The committee also expressed concerns about the UK Government\\'s legacy commitment. \"We were promised a strong Olympic legacy but the Government has chosen not to adopt the target of one million more people participating in sport by 2013,\" Hodge said. But Hugh Robertson, the government\\'s minister for sport, rejected the committee\\'s findings. \"What (the committee) has not done is made any allowance for the amount of money that comes back to the public purse once the land on the park has been sold,\" Robertson told the BBC. Should the committee\\'s estimates be borne out, the projected cost of staging the Games will have almost trebled from an initial bid estimate of £4 billion ($6.3 billion). That figure was revised up to £9.3 billion in 2007. The Olympics and Paralympic Games get underway on July 27 and August 29 respectively.',\n",

Andy Murray admits it will be a relief to defend his Wimbledon title without the same pressure that had followed him throughout his career before last year's victory. The Scot ended a 77-year wait for a British champion by defeating Novak Djokovic in last year's final and returns to the Championships without wearing that albatross around his neck for the first time. 'It builds to a point where last year was by far the most extreme pressure I’d felt in my career. It’s nice not to worry about it now,' Murray told the Evening Standard. All white on the night: Andy Murray models the new adidas collection he will be wearing at Wimbledon . Tough times: Andy Murray has had to deal with injury problems and changing coach since last summer . Three is the magic number! Andy Murray has been seeded third for his defence of the Wimbledon title . Since banishing the ghosts of Fred Perry last summer, Murray has struggled on tour as a consequence of two defining events - splitting with coach Ivan Lendl and undergoing crucial back surgery. Murray had an operation in September to resolve an issue with his back that had been troubling him for years, and is starting to feel the benefits. 'I was having to change the way I was training to try to deal with the back and it just got to a point where I was like ‘I’m tired of this’. 'I feel better now than I did, not so much endurance wise but in terms of the shots I can play without being in pain,' he says. However, while the physical scars of his operation are starting to heal, the British No 1 is still recovering from the emotional turmoil of ending his relationship with Lendl in March. Relief: Andy Murray admits it will be nice to play at Wimbledon without the usual pressure . At last! Andy Murray ended a 77-yer wait for a British champion after wining last year's Championships . 'It was like a double blow, it was a real setback for sure but only for a few weeks and then it’s time to move on. 'I spent a couple of great years with him but it’s time to try to move on.' Murray has since become the first high profile player to take on a female coach after agreeing to work with Former World No 1 Amelie Mauresmo at SW19. 'Ivan’s game was very consistent, high percentage, very solid, no weaknesses, he just did everything, well, great. Amelie played with more variety and flair, came to the net more, did more top spin,' he said. 'That’s more my sort of style so it might be a bit easier for her to explain those things to me and help me work on my strengths a bit more.' Girl power: Murray has become the first high profile player to take on a woman coach in Amelie Maursemo (L) Best defence: Andy Murray can count on previous experience when he tries to repeat history at SW19 . Murray, who has been seeded third, has been handed a favourable draw and will face Belgian David Goffin in the first round. He admits that successfully defending his crown will be challenging, but at least he can count on previous experience. 'Is it easier to win it a first time or defend it? I don’t know.

Fida was a member of the U.S. Army's 7th Division, which helped capture the island after a four-day battle against the Japanese. Survivor: World War II veteran Donald Fida of Syracuse, pictured, fought in five battles including the invasion of Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands . The Post-Standard of Syracuse reported that Fida was twenty years old at the time, and also fought in Okinawa and three other battles. The Japanese captured Fida, wounded his stomach and performed an incomplete castration while he was in the Phillippines, the veteran told the newspaper. Fida claimed that a school acquaintance saved him and tended to him. He received a Purple Heart and went back to Syracuse  in 1945 and later began a landscaping business, the newspaper reported. The 33 7th Division vets still alive were invited back to the island for a ceremony marking the battle's 71st anniversary, according to The Post-Standard of Syracuse - which explained that medical treatment available on Kwajalein mandates that traveling veterans must be capable of walking. 'Out of 22,000 men in the 7th Division, I'm the only one that can walk,' Fida told the newspaper. Going with his daughter Donna Wisniewski, he'll be the only 7th Division veteran attending the ceremony. 'I'm so grateful that I'm able to do this at my age and to be able to remember all of this, which is a miracle to some people,' Fida told The Post-Standard of Syracuse. Fida told the newspaper he frequently thinks of his memories from Kwajalein - including how he used a fallen comrade and friend's dead body to protect himself from bullets and informed the man's family of what happened in 2003. Fida will turn 91 on January 28 - with his Kwajalein arrival date being  January 29, the newspaper reported. Memories: Fida holds a photograph of himself during his WWII service.

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- At about 33 feet long, weighing 4 to 5 tons and baring large blade-shaped teeth, the dinosaur Torvosaurus gurneyi was a formidable creature. \"I suppose it wouldn\\'t be a good idea to cross the way of this dinosaur,\" said Christophe Hendrickx, doctoral candidate at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal. Thanks to Hendrickx and paleontologist Octavio Mateus, Torvosaurus gurneyi may have the distinction of being the largest terrestrial predator found in Europe. Hendrickx and Mateus describe this dinosaur in a new study in the journal PLOS One. The remains of Torvosaurus gurneyi were discovered at the Lourinha Formation, a fruitful site of dinosaur bones north of Lisbon. Before this study, bones that scientists say belong to the new species were thought to belong to Torvosaurus tanneri, a North American dinosaur species. But comparisons between the remains of the Portuguese and North American specimens suggest that they warrant distinct species names. For instance, Torvosaurus tanneri had at least 11 teeth, while Torvosaurus gurneyi had fewer, scientists said. Torvosaurus gurneyi lived about 150 million years ago. The continents had previously all been one land mass, but by the time of this dinosaur, the Iberian Peninsula had broken off from North America, Hendrickx said. \"The study provides compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that temporary connections between North America and Europe existed during the Late Jurassic, and these allowed for intercontinental faunal mixing,\" Gregory Erickson, a Florida State University paleobiologist not involved in the study, said via e-mail. Subsequent geographic isolation led to the development of distinct species, Erickson said. The Tyrannosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus from the Cretaceous period -- defined as 145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago -- were larger than Torvosaurus gurneyi. But this European giant seems to have been a powerful predator. The dinosaur appears to have been a carnivore that probably ate herbivorous dinosaurs. Its teeth were nearly 4 inches long; its skull was thought to be about 45 inches long. The environment where it lived was tropical, with temperatures ranging from 86 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. A diverse collection of dinosaurs roamed the area. \"The fauna was certainly dominated by dinosaurs,\" Hendrickx said. Specimens that most likely belong to this species include an upper jaw bone, teeth and partial tail vertebrae, remnants discovered in 2003. Hendrickx proposes other material found at the same site in Portugal also belongs to Torvosaurus gurneyi. A tibia and femur seem to fit the profile, as do embryos that Hendrickx, Mateus and colleagues described in the journal Nature last year. Torvosaurus gurneyi could have been covered with proto-feathers, given evidence from closely related dinosaurs, the scientists said. But as for its colors, no one yet knows. Erickson called the discovery exciting. It demonstrates that large theropods -- meat-eating dinosaurs -- lived in Europe during the Late Jurassic. \"Torvosaurus gurneyi was the T. rex of its time,\" Erickson said. Hendrickx named the species after James Gurney, an artist and writer known for the illustrated \"Dinotopia\" book series about -- guess what? -- a society of people and dinosaurs.

       " {'article': 'Retired Army Gen. David Petraeus resigned from his post as CIA director last week after an FBI investigation revealed he had an extramarital affair. The investigation also prompted questions about whether his paramour had inappropriate access to classified information. The scandal also has sparked an investigation into whether Marine Corps Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, sent inappropriate messages to a different woman, leading President Obama to put Allen\\'s nomination to become NATO\\'s supreme allied chief on hold. The FBI uncovered the Petraeus affair while it investigated e-mails that his paramour, Paula Broadwell, allegedly sent to a Petraeus family friend, Jill Kelley, according to a U.S. official. Kelley, meanwhile, is the woman to whom Allen allegedly sent inappropriate e-mails, according to the Defense Department. Below is a summary of what we know about the situation. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . New developments . -- A week after resigning as CIA director, Petraeus testified Friday in closed hearings to the House and Senate Intelligence committees about the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. -- Petraeus said the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism committed by al Qaeda-linked militants, said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican. Petraeus \"stated that he thought all along he made it clear that there was significant terrorist involvement,\" according to King. The congressman said \"the clear impression\" he got from Petraeus in September testimony was that the attack \"arose out of a spontaneous demonstration.\" -- According to King and other lawmakers, Petraeus testified that his resignation was not linked to the attack, a concern raised by administration detractors, given the timing of his departure just before the beginning of the hearings. -- Kelley visited the White House complex three times since September 28, a White House official said. The first two were for meals in the White House cafeteria with her sister and a White House staffer who met the Kelley family while visiting MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, and the third one -- on November 4 -- was a White House tour along with her husband and their three children, said the official. Petraeus: I did not pass on classified information . Opinion: 5 things we\\'ve learned from Petraeus scandal . The Petraeus affair . -- The FBI uncovered the affair between Petraeus, 60, and his biographer, Broadwell, 40, after Broadwell allegedly sent anonymous, harassing e-mails about Kelley -- first to Allen in May, and then to Kelley and her husband in June -- according to sources familiar with the case. -- Allen told Kelley about the e-mail he received, and Kelley eventually told an FBI agent -- a friend of hers -- about the messages, sources say. -- Kelley, 37, and her husband are friends of Petraeus and his family and friends of Allen. A Central Command spokesman said she is a volunteer with no official position at MacDill Air Force Base, where the U.S. Central Command is headquartered. -- The FBI determined that the messages came from Broadwell. One of the messages to Kelley was along the lines of \"stay away from my guy,\" a U.S. official says. -- During the investigation of the e-mails, other communications surfaced connecting Petraeus and Broadwell, who is a married mother of two living in North Carolina, an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve and a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of War Studies at King\\'s College London. CIA vs. FBI in Petraeus scandal . -- Broadwell, a West Point graduate, had written a biography of Petraeus, published in January, called \"All In: The Education of General David Petraeus.\" She met Petraeus in 2006 when he spoke at Harvard, where she was a graduate student. She wrote the book after researching Petraeus for her Ph.D. dissertation on his leadership skills and visiting him and his team in Afghanistan, where he became top U.S. commander in 2010. -- Petraeus and Broadwell began their affair in fall 2011, a few months after he returned to the United States, retired from the Army and took over at the CIA, according to a Petraeus friend. They ended it in the summer of 2012, Petraeus\\' friend said. -- On Election Day, November 6, Petraeus told Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the affair, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. Clapper advised Petraeus to resign, the official said. -- On November 9, Petraeus quit the CIA over the affair. The House and Senate intelligence committees were informed of the FBI investigation the same day. -- Petraeus\\' resignation came just days before he was scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the September 11 attack that killed four Americans at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Will national security scandal create national security risk? The Allen allegations . -- The Defense Department\\'s inspector general is investigating allegations thatt Allen sent inappropriate messages to Kelley, the department said Tuesday. The FBI told the department about the allegations Sunday. -- Allen has denied wrongdoing, a senior defense official said. Sources familiar with Kelley have said the relationship between the two was not sexual. Authorities are looking at the e-mails. -- \"There is no affair\" between Allen and Kelley, a senior official close to Kelley said. \"She is a bored rich socialite involved with every single senior commander at CentCom, because she worked as an honorary ambassador.\" -- A U.S. official familiar with the e-mails Allen sent to Kelley said, \"If they got out, John Allen would be very embarrassed by them.\" The official added that there was no evidence of physical contact between the two. Investigations and fallout . -- The FBI is reviewing the actions of Frederick Humphries, the agent who triggered an investigation into e-mails received by Kelley,  a law enforcement official said Thursday. The agency will look at whether Humphries followed proper procedures in speaking to some members of Congress about his concerns about how the agency was handling Kelley\\'s case. --  Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that he didn\\'t tell the White House about the Petraeus investigation because it was determined there was no threat to national security. \"Had we made a determination that a threat to national security existed, we would of course had made that known to the president and to the appropriate members on the Hill,\" Holder told reporters. -- Broadwell, an Army Reserve officer, has had her government security clearance suspended pending the outcome of ongoing investigations, two U.S. officials with direct knowledge told CNN\\'s Barbara Starr on Wednesday. -- Broadwell\\'s affair with Petraeus has raised questions about whether it gave her access to national security information that she shouldn\\'t have had. The allegedly harassing e-mails detailed the \"comings and goings of the generals and Ms. Kelley,\" according to a source. One of them was believed to be Petraeus, and because parts his schedule were not public, questions arose about whether the sender had access to sensitive information. -- In a speech at the University of Denver at the end of October, Broadwell suggested the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi took place because the United States was housing Libyan prisoners there -- a theory, she noted, that had not been vetted yet. The claim has since been discounted by administration officials. Broadwell\\'s source for that previously unpublished information remains unclear, and there\\'s no evidence that it came from Petraeus. -- Investigators have found classified information on a computer belonging to Broadwell, a law enforcement source told CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend on Wednesday. -- A senior law enforcement official close to the Broadwell investigation said Wednesday night that materials taken from Broadwell\\'s home were under review, and that it appeared unlikely she would be prosecuted for any unauthorized release of classified information. -- On Tuesday, John Nagl, a retired military officer who worked for Petraeus for years and whom the former CIA director authorized to talk, said that Petraeus insists he never shared classified information with Broadwell. -- Obama said Wednesday that he had seen no evidence of a potentially damaging breach in national security stemming from the affair involving Petraeus. No sex required for unfaithfulness to begin . -- Obama also said Wednesday that Petraeus served his country with \"great distinction,\" and he hoped that Petraeus\\' affair and resignation are \"a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career.\" -- Kelley\\'s access to Florida\\'s MacDill Air Force Base without an escort has been suspended, a Defense Department official said Wednesday. Kelley had been given special access to the base because of her position as a booster and promoter of programs to help U.S. troops, the official said. -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she would investigate why the FBI did not notify congressional oversight committees about its investigation into Petraeus after the bureau determined he was having a secret extramarital affair. -- Petraeus has not been following the media firestorm over the extramarital affair that led to his resignation. \"He wants to maintain a distance and focus on his family at this time,\" his aide, retired Col. Peter Mansoor, said Wednesday. -- While the nature of the relationship between Allen and Kelley, if any, is unclear, evidence of an affair could subject the general to military prosecution. Adultery is a violation of military law. -- Obama has put Allen\\'s nomination to become NATO\\'s supreme allied commander on hold pending the outcome of the investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. --  A U.S. official told CNN that the CIA has launched an investigation into the \"general conduct\" of Petraeus that will look into whether he used agency resources in carrying out his affair with Broadwell.',\n",

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- \"King\" Alex Ferguson is quitting Manchester United but the football team\\'s $3.17 billion brand will survive, according to experts. Ferguson -- the man who helped propel Manchester United to one of the world\\'s biggest sport brands -- is set to step down at the end of the season after 26 years at the club. The 71-year-old Scot has managed the English club -- which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has millions of fans around the world -- since 1986. During his 26 years as manager, Ferguson has won more than 30 trophies, including 13 league championships. Watch more: What is Sir Alex\\'s football legacy? And while brand expert Jonathan Gabay believes there will be a period of uncertainty at the club following the exit of a \"living legend,\" the \"Brand Manchester United\" will survive long after his reign. \"The king is dead, but that doesn\\'t mean there will never be a king again,\" Gabay told CNN, \"He [Ferguson] is part of a legendary football brand, but he\\'s not bigger than the actual brand itself.\" Watch more: Watch 2012 interview with Ferguson . Andre Spicer, a professor of Organizational Behavior at the Cass Business School in London, said the loss of a \"great leader\" such as Ferguson is similar to \"enduring a death\" for a company. Ferguson\\'s retirement has already sparked a media and fan frenzy of speculation over his successor. Spicer added that fans will idealize the achievements of Ferguson and as such \"it becomes impossible for a successor to fill the old leader\\'s shoes.\" Watch more: Manchester United\\'s future after Fergie . The Scot\\'s decision to retire and the appointment of his successor could also have a significant impact on the club financially . Since the first season of the English Premier League in 1992/3 season, Manchester United\\'s revenue has grown from £25.2 million to £320.3 million for the 2011/12 season. \"Manchester United has been transformed as a football club under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson,\" according to Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. While Andy Milligan, a partner at business consultancy, Caffeine, and author of football business book \"Brand it Like Beckham,\" said that club owners, the Glazers, may go into \"overdrive\" in the next 24 hours to reassure global stakeholders that the club\\'s stability, on the pitch, is not at risk. Milligan said Manchester United\\'s next appointment may be as much about reassuring investors outside the U.K. as it will be for sporting reasons. Milligan told CNN: \"Football is a very volatile market place. But if you add U.S. stock market pressures to football; it could be an explosive mix.\" Manchester United\\'s American owners, the Glaziers, listed the soccer club on the New York Stock Exchange in August and its growing commercial success is highly dependent on performances on the pitch, according to Joshua Raymond, a market strategist at London-based financial services firm, CityIndex. \"Replacing Alex Ferguson is a monumental task and one that shareholders will watch with great interest and nervous uncertainty,\" he said in a note on the firm\\'s website. Raymond wrote that the appointment of Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho would be \"a much safer appointment in the eyes of the United board and shareholders\" while the appointment of Everton manager and bookmakers favorite, David Moyes, would \"come with great risk\" due to his lack of experience with big clubs. In his note, Raymond went on to say that Mourinho would be the only appointment that could increase the club\\'s brand recognition. Manchester United is one of the world\\'s most valuable clubs -- second only to Spanish giants Real Madrid -- according to a study by financial experts, Forbes. In the club\\'s third-quarter results, the English Premier League champions posted record revenue of £91.7 million ($142 million) on the back of new sponsorship deals in Asia and Europe. The club, who have just claimed their 20th league title, reported a 52.2% increase in sponsorship revenue having announced new deals with two financial services providers in Denmark and Vietnam as well as an agreement with a Japanese social gaming company.',\n",

       " {'article': 'Canadian authorities have arrested two men accused of planning to carry out an al Qaeda-supported attack against a passenger train traveling between Canada and the United States, a U.S. congressman told CNN on Monday. \"As I understand it, it was a train going from Canada to the U.S.,\" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chairman of the counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee, said. The news follows an announcement earlier in the day by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that they had arrested Chiheb Esseghaier, 30, and Raed Jaser, 35. The two men are charged with \"receiving support from al Qaeda elements in Iran\" to carry out an attack and conspiring to murder people on a VIA railway train in the greater Toronto area, Assistant Police Commissioner James Malizia said. \"When I speak about supported, I mean direction and guidance,\" he said. Despite the allegation of links to al Qaeda in Iran, there was no evidence to suggest the planned attacks were state-sponsored, Malizia said. Iran vehemently denied the allegations that al Qaeda was operating inside its borders. \"Iran\\'s position against this group is very clear and well known,\" according to a statement released by Iran\\'s mission to the United Nations. \"Al Qaeda has no possibility to do any activity inside Iran or conduct any operation abroad from Iran\\'s territory, and we reject strongly and categorically any connection to this story.\" Neither the Canadian authorities nor King identified the exact route of the targeted train. Essenghaier, of Montreal, and Jaser, of Toronto, will make their first court appearance on Tuesday, police said. Authorities said the suspects were not Canadian citizens, but declined to identify their nationality or how long they had been in Canada. Essenghaier has been a doctoral student at the National Institute of Scientific Research at the University of Quebec since 2010, Julie Martineau, the university spokeswoman, said. He was conducting research on nanosensors, which are primarily used for medical treatments or to build other nanoproducts, such as computer chips, she said. \"I cannot comment on any behavior issues. He seemed like a normal student,\" Martineau said. There was no link between the Canadian investigation and the Boston Marathon bomb attack, an official with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told CNN on condition of anonymity. Canadian authorities were tight-lipped about the planned time frame of the alleged attack except to say it was in the planning stage and not imminent. \"We are alleging these two individuals took steps and conducted activities to conduct a terrorist attack,\" Jennifer Strachan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told reporters. \"They watched trains and railways in the greater Toronto area.\" The alleged attack included a plan to derail a passenger train, she said. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation quoted \"highly placed sources\" as saying the suspects were under surveillance for more than a year. The CBC reported that the investigation was \"part of a cross-border operation involving Canadian law enforcement agencies, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\" Al Qaeda has long studied the possibility of attacks on railroad systems -- seeing them as cheap, relatively easy to carry out and with potentially devastating results. The organization and its sympathizers have plotted attacks on railway systems in Spain and Germany. More than 200 people were killed and 1,700 injured in an attack that targeted several commuter trains in Madrid in March 2004. In a document seized during the raid in Pakistan that left Osama bin Laden dead was evidence of an al Qaeda discussion to target rail lines in the United States, a law enforcement official told CNN in late 2011. According to the document, al Qaeda members discussed as early as 2010 a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and in valleys. The plan, according to the document, was to be executed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, though no specific rail system was identified, the official said. News of the arrests Monday came the same day Canada\\'s parliament debated an anti-terrorism bill. Traditionally, al Qaeda\\'s membership is seen as Sunni-dominated and not Shiite. As a result, al Qaeda and Iran have not been viewed as allies. \"We have very little intelligence on al Qaeda in Iran,\" King said. What is known is that bin Laden\\'s son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, fled Afghanistan for Iran after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. According to U.S. documents and officials, in addition to Abu Ghaith, other members of bin Laden\\'s inner circle ended up in Iran, including  the formidable military commander of al Qaeda, Saif al-Adel, and Saad bin Laden, one of the al Qaeda leader\\'s older sons who has played some kind of leadership role in the group. Saad bin Laden also helped one of his father\\'s wives and several of his father\\'s children to move from Pakistan to Iran, officials said.',\n",

She was defending herself,' cries Daniel Crespo Jr. Scroll down to listen to audio . Better times: A wailing 19-year-old Daniel Crespo Jr. (far right) called 911 September 30 after his mother shot his mayor father multiple times in the torso during a domestic altercation. A top right is Mrs. Levette Crespo with her daughter Chrystal at center . His mother, 43-year-old Levette Crespo, had been in a fight with her husband when their son tried to intervene, according to KTLA. The father and son dispute turned abusive, said Crespo Jr. And that's when Mrs. Crespo snapped. Police say she fired multiple times into her high school sweetheart husband's torso. 'My parents got in an argument and there were shots fired,' Crespo Jr. cried into the phone, in a call punctuated by several long silences from the victim's end. 'He hurt me. He hurt me,' Crespo Jr. said, as if in explanation. 'He's on the floor dying, OK? He hurt me.' As police arrived, the 911 call ended. Lawyer Eber Bayona said Lyvette Crespo has cooperated with authorities since the outset and was released after questioning. There has been no arrest and no criminal charges thus far. Domestic unrest: The Bell Gardens mayor was in an argument with his wife when his son reportedly interviewed. The two men then got into a physical fight . Levette Crespo's lawyer told reporters outside Bell Gardens City Hall that the stay-at-home mother, whom police questioned and released following the shooting on Tuesday, was a victim in the case along with her husband, Daniel Crespo. Police have not said who owned the gun. In addition to serving as mayor of Bell Gardens, Crespo worked as a Los Angeles County probation officer for over 20 years. Neighbors had never complained of arguments coming from the house, Daniel Crespo's friend Joaquin Madrigal, who met the mayor 25 years ago, told Reuters in an interview. 'It was a huge surprise,' he said in Spanish. 'We never thought anything would happen in his house.' Madrigal described Levette Crespo as quiet, serious and reserved, a woman who tried to keep herself and her children out of her husband's political world. A friend of Daniel Crespo said he was friendly and enjoyed karaoke to relieve the pressures of his job. 'It's very hard to picture what they're saying,' said Albert Bernal, who met Crespo during his 2000 campaign and was helping plan a vigil for the mayor on Friday evening. 'I just want justice for my brother,' the mayor's brother, William Crespo, said outside City Hall. 'It wasn't my mom's fault. She was defending herself': Crespo's 43-year-old wife shot her husband multiple times in the torso during the struggle. He later was pronounced dead at a hospital, but Mrs. Crespo faces no charges . Counterpoint: William Crespo, the mayor's brother, said allegations of physical abuse and cheating were a lie. He said he wants his sister-in-law to be charged with second-degree murder, adding that she knows how to use a gun. 'I think the evidence will corroborate she has been the victim of domestic violence for many years,' attorney Eber Bayona said. 'What happened Tuesday in the Crespo home is a tragedy. Everyone is a victim.' Claudia Osuna, an attorney for the couple's son and daughter, said the children stood behind their mother. Bayona added: 'In this case, there may be a chance to learn about the difficult and intolerable home life for this family.' It has also been reported that reported that Crespo may have kept one or more women on the side. The Los Angeles Times reported that 'law enforcement sources [...] said they had received information that Crespo had relationships with women besides his wife.'\",\n",

In Monaco, though, they recall former club president Jean-Louis Campora taking a 37-year-old coach who had been relegated with Nancy and installing him with a multi-million budget. Jean Petit was Wenger’s assistant when Mark Hateley and Glenn Hoddle were at the club. ‘I remember the president asking me whether I knew Arsene,’ said Petit, who is still a coach at Monaco. Arsene Wenger took Hateley and Hoddle to the south of France and won the Ligue 1 title in their first year . There were plenty of smiles when Hoddle and Hateley were reunited with club stalwart Jean Petit . The Prince and his players: Glenn Hoddle and Mark Hateley return to Monaco 27 years after they won the title . If Arsene Wenger wins the Champions League I don't think Tottenham fans will ever forgive me... I told Arsenal to sign him, says  Hoddle . ‘I had a friend, Jean-Marc Guillou [former France and Nice player], who knew him, and he said to me: “He will become one of the best managers in the world.” And when he came, you could see he would be someone important. He knew football. He was an intelligent young man who had a certain idea of football, tactically. ‘He came here with new methods, he made Monaco more professional. In training methods, in making sure our trips to and from games were done in private planes, those kind of things. Arsene was the start of the modern Monaco.’ But there is one feature of Wenger’s personality in those years which comes as a surprise. ‘He could get really angry in the dressing room,’ said Hoddle. Hateley added: ‘The veins used to pop out of his head! He was an absolute firebomb in the dressing room if he wasn’t getting what he wanted.’ Arsene Wenger was capable of the odd explosion in the dressing room, the English duo say . Sir Alex Ferguson was famed for his explosions and the Glaswegian's dreaded hairdryer treatment . Hoddle said: ‘I remember talking to Tony Adams about him when he was at Arsenal. He told me he was very passive and never really got annoyed. And I thought: “Well he’s changed then. Because he did with us!”’ Wenger would leave Monaco in 1994. ‘It wasn’t the results, though,’ said Petit. ‘It was more to do with the relationship with the president. The marriage was over.’\",\n",

       " {'article': 'Who killed and decapitated an 88-year-old Georgia man, and where is his 87-year-old wife? Russell Dermond\\'s death and Shirley Dermond\\'s disappearance are mysteries detectives are trying to unravel -- and fast. \"We need to assume, or at least pray, that Mrs. Dermond is still alive, and we desperately need to know her whereabouts,\" Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said Thursday. Investigators are treating her disappearance as an abduction, he said. There is no indication she\\'s a suspect, and there\\'s \"plenty\" to indicate she was taken, he said. Her pocketbook, cell phone and vehicle were all at the million-dollar waterfront home where her husband\\'s headless body was found. Investigators believe Russell Dermond was killed between last Friday and Sunday, and they\\'re still searching for his severed head, Sills told reporters, describing the case as \"very unusual\" and the most frustrating homicide of his career. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s a random incident. I think for whatever reason these people were singled out for this,\" Sills said. \"They live in the most exclusive neighborhood, or one of the most exclusive neighborhoods, in this county. ... They\\'re on a cul-de-sac in a gated, multimillion dollar resort community that we have no crime in.\" Sills said he can\\'t recall a burglary in the neighborhood in his 18 years as sheriff. The Dermonds\\' friends hadn\\'t heard from them in days and went to their home in the upscale, gated, lakeside Great Waters community, where they found Russell Dermond in the garage. \"I don\\'t know that that\\'s the murder scene, but there\\'s obviously blood,\" Sills said. Authorities have searched Lake Oconee in the vicinity of the Dermonds\\' home -- turning up only a lawn chair and a Christmas tree -- and sent cadaver dogs into the nearby woods, to no avail, Sills said. Police have also spoken to neighbors, family and friends. So far, the investigation has turned up little to shed light on the crimes. Investigators aren\\'t aware of any enemies the couple had made, or any reason someone would target them, he said. \"If I had a good, solid lead, guess what? I wouldn\\'t be standing here talking to you,\" the sheriff told reporters. \"The only person who\\'s not a suspect is Sheriff Sills, because I know where I was.\" \\'This has been a shock\\' Residents described Reynolds Plantation -- a tony resort community about 75 miles east of Atlanta, which also boasts a Jack Nicklaus signature golf course and a Ritz-Carlton Lodge -- as a safe enclave where people were comfortable leaving their doors unlocked. \"There is no crime in this area, no crime whatsoever,\" Lillian Butterworth told CNN. \"Nothing has ever happened here before, so this has been a shock to us.\" Added resident Johnny Wagoner, \"It\\'s just a total sense of sadness and confusion on how this could happen here -- and obviously a great deal of concern for Shirley and our prayers and hopes that she will be found.\" The 3,300-square-foot home where the Dermonds have lived since 1994 is valued at more than $1 million and sits on Lake Oconee, in the bucolic Great Waters neighborhood of Reynolds Plantation. Off a moderately trafficked rural road, a divided, two-lane road lined with trees and a white fence winds through large, green expanses of tall grass, past a guard house into the neighborhood. At this point, investigators don\\'t know whether the suspect or suspects approached the home by land or via the lake. Sills said it isn\\'t uncommon to see fishermen casting lures in the middle of the night. Without any clear leads as to Shirley Dermond\\'s whereabouts, he said, investigators are now asking the public for help. Shirley Dermond is 5-foot-2 and weighs 148 pounds. She has gray hair and blue eyes. And she is believed to be in danger, Sills told local media. Anyone with more information should call the Putnam County Sheriff\\'s Office at 706-485-8557. Details of the case have baffled investigators. \"You\\'ve got such unusual circumstances here,\" Sills said. \"If it\\'s an abduction, you would expect some sort of extortion demand. If it was an assassination, you\\'d think both bodies would be there. And then you have, totally, nothing in their background that indicates anything like this, and then the area where it happened is not indicative of any type of homicide.\" Couple was \\'sweet as can be\\' A Georgia Bureau of Investigation source confirmed the bureau was conducting Russell Dermond\\'s autopsy but wouldn\\'t comment further. The FBI also is assisting and, likewise, reticent, saying only that it \"is providing limited support based on the needs and requests from Putnam County authorities,\" according to Stephen Emmett, spokesman for the FBI\\'s Atlanta office. Meanwhile, the sheriff said, rumors have been flying in the small community. He told CNN earlier Thursday that information suggesting authorities had found parts of Shirley Dermond\\'s body were \"totally false\" and asked CNN to \"help stop the false reports, as they are interfering with our investigation.\" Little else is known about the couple, both of whom were born in New Jersey. Police and friends are at a loss for why they would be the targets of such violence. Compounding the mystery is that the home was pristine. There is no sign of a break-in, a scuffle or anything missing. Their vehicles were at the home, police said. Russell Dermond has paid taxes on a 23-foot boat, which Sills said the couple recently sold, and Dermond reportedly owned fast-food restaurants. Tax records connect him to a Wendy\\'s and a Chick-fil-A. The Rev. David Key of Lake Oconee Community Church said he has known the couple for about eight years and counts them among his church\\'s 350 attendees. He\\'s \"baffled\" as to why anyone would commit such crimes against them, he said, as they were grounded, \"beloved in the community\" and \"sweet as can be.\" They were active in the church and family-oriented, he said. The Dermonds, who have been married 68 years, had three adult children, he said, as well as grandchildren, though he wasn\\'t certain how many. \"Number one, we are devastated by Russell having died and the violence around that,\" Key said. \"And not knowing what happened to (Shirley). ... It is dealing with the tragedy of what we do know and the uncertainty of what lies ahead.\"',\n",

       " {'article': 'ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain on Monday defended his opposition to a Democratic bill that would expand education benefits for veterans, saying it would hurt the military that he hopes to lead. Sen. John McCain is co-sponsoring alternative legislation to the GI Bill that the Senate passed last week. The new GI Bill being debated in Congress would expand education benefits for veterans who served at least three years in the military after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The bill\\'s main sponsor, Sen. Jim Webb, is a Virginia Democrat and, like McCain, a Vietnam War veteran. The Senate passed Webb\\'s bill 75-22 last week. McCain was not in Washington for the vote. Democrats have targeted McCain for his opposition to the Webb legislation. Watch McCain talk about the U.S. debt to veterans . Saying he takes \"a back seat to no one in my affection, respect and devotion to veterans,\" McCain said Webb\\'s bill would be a disincentive for service members to become noncommissioned officers, which he called \"the backbone of all the services.\" \"In my life, I have learned more from noncommissioned officers I have known and served with than anyone else outside my family,\" McCain said at a Memorial Day event in Albuquerque. \"They are very hard to replace. Encouraging people to choose to not become noncommissioned officers would hurt the military and our country very badly.\" A former Navy officer, McCain was a prisoner of war during Vietnam. McCain, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina, has introduced an alternative bill that would increase education benefits on a sliding scale based on an individual\\'s years of service. McCain argues his bill would have a smaller impact on retention rates than the legislation that the Senate passed. \"The office of president, which I am seeking, is a great honor indeed, but it imposes serious responsibilities,\" the presumptive GOP nominee said. \"I can only tell you, I intend to deserve the honor if I am fortunate to receive it, even if it means I must take politically unpopular positions at times and disagree with people for whom I have the highest respect and affection.\" Over the weekend, Sen. Barack Obama, who appears to be the likely Democratic nominee, again tried to tie McCain to Bush by noting that both of them oppose the GI Bill expansion. \"I revere our soldiers and want to make sure they are being treated with honor and respect,\" Obama said Saturday. \"I think the GI Bill is one way for us to do that, and I hope that John McCain and George Bush decide they believe the same thing.\" Sparring between McCain and Obama over the GI Bill got personal last week when McCain said he would not be lectured from someone \"who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform.\" Obama hasn\\'t served in the military. Referring to Iraq in his closing comments Monday, McCain said he recognized Americans have grown tired of the war and the mistakes made, \"but we cannot react to those mistakes by embracing a course of action that will be an even greater mistake, a mistake of colossal historical proportions.\" \"We must give Gen. [David] Petraeus and the Americans he has the honor to command adequate time to salvage from the wreckage of our past mistakes a measure of stability for Iraq and the Middle East, and a more secure future for the American people,\" he said. Later Monday, McCain will attend a fundraiser in Albuquerque. On Tuesday, President Bush will fly to Phoenix, Arizona, for a fundraiser at a private residence. Bush has been one of the Republican Party\\'s most prolific fundraisers, and McCain will need help to keep up with Democratic fundraising this fall. The McCain campaign said the event will be held at the senator\\'s home because it is more private. But the Phoenix Business Journal said the event was moved from the Phoenix Convention Center due to lackluster ticket sales and concern over anti-war protesters. A McCain aide denied the report on poor ticket sales. The aide also said the event wasn\\'t moved to McCain\\'s private residence to avoid having the senator and unpopular president appear together on camera. \"We have a policy that fundraising events are closed events,\" the aide said, adding that any confusion about the fundraiser originally being open to the press should be chalked up to the campaign \"working out the kinks\" on its first event with Bush. McCain consistently has trailed the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates in fundraising. The $17 million McCain raised in April was dwarfed by the nearly $31 million by Obama and the $21 million by Sen. Hillary Clinton. McCain also trails both Democrats in the amount of cash on hand. He had nearly $22 million in the bank at the end of April, while Obama had more than double that amount -- nearly $47 million -- and Clinton had nearly $30 million. CNN\\'s Alexander Marquardt, Ed Henry, Mary Snow and Robert Yoon contributed to this report.',\n",

       " {'article': \"George Osborne today tore into the Lib Dems, accusing his coalition partners of risking 'chaos' in the economy. The Chancellor called on the Lib Dems to lay out plans for 'hefty' income tax rises after the election to deal with the deficit. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg hit back, and said the Tories had to 'come clean' about closing colleges and libraries, and cutting police budgets to make their figures add up. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne warned the Lib Dems' economic plans would wreak 'chaos' by imposing 'hefty' tax rises . The Tories are also furious that Vince Cable hailed the Autumn Statement as 'excellent' in a meeting for the Cabinet before criticising it in public. Tensions in the coalition have mounted in the wake of Mr Osborne's mini-Budget, in which he overhauled stamp duty and targeted non-doms and foreign firms for tax rises, but also admitted dramatic spending cuts were still needed to balance the books. The Lib Dems sought to insist scrapping the 'slab' system of stamp duty had been their policy since 2007, while also claiming credit for increasing the income tax personal allowance to £10,600. Both parties signed up to billions of pounds in spending on roads, housing and flood defences. But the prospect of huge spending cuts to eradicate a deficit of £91billion has caused bitter divisions. The Tories say the money can be found entirely through spending cuts, with welfare bearing the brunt. But the Lib Dems argue a fifth of the money can be raise through extra taxes, including a mansion tax on £2million homes. Mr Osborne insisted the measure would do little to balance the books and the Lib Dems would have to use other hikes to make up the shortfall. 'It's hard to work out exactly what they (the Lib Dems) think,' Mr Osborne wrote in The Sunday Times. 'While they sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts. 'But they shouldn't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone. 'If you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting, you'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the Tories had to 'come clean' about the impact of trying to eradicate the deficit from spending cuts alone . In a direct pitch for voters to give the Tories an overall majority in 2015, Mr Osborne insisted both Labour and the Lib Dems were a risk to the economy. The Chancellor added: 'The battle lines for the general election have been drawn this week. There's a clear choice: a competent plan to stay on course to prosperity with us or a return to economic chaos with all the alternatives.' However, Mr Clegg hit back, claiming it was not possible to tackle the deficit through spending cuts alone. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'I think it is impossible to balance the books, shrink the state, deliver unfunded tax cuts and protect the public services that people treasure, supporting the police, supporting the NHS, the schools and colleges. 'I do think the Conservatives need to come clean. How many colleges will be closed? How many police need to be taken off our streets?' With five months to go until the general election, there are increasingly bitter divisions in the coalition between the two parties. Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts . Last week Mr Osborne claimed the Lib Dems signed up to government spending plans in private but now 'slag them off' in public. After the Chancellor presented the details of the Autumn Statement to the Cabinet on Wednesday morning, Mr Cable described it as 'excellent'. But later that day he said he 'did not recognise' the Chancellor's plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018-19. He also said: 'We do have differences in emphasis. The Tories would like to cut spending rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable.' 'He told everyone how good he thought it was, and then went out and criticised it,' said a Cabinet source.\",\n",

Jenna Gavin was fishing with her parents in the Northumberland Straight, Nova Scotia . Now, her success is likely to get her into the record books for the biggest fish ever landed by a girl aged between 11 and 16. Details of the massive fish have been sent to the International Game Fishing Association for verification. For the record to stand, Jenna's parents had to leave her alone to battle and land the tuna. The youngster's mother Chandra said: 'Jenna was thrilled when she finished the fight and was really excited when we pulled it out of the water to put it on the deck. 1,496 The weight in pounds which an adult bluefin tuna can reach . 1.05 The amount in millions a tuna sold at auction in Japan in January . 43 The speed in miles per hour they can travel . 4,000 The distance in miles a bluefin tuna will migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to Iceland . 3,500 The price per pound a fresh bluefin tuna in perfect condition can reach . 1,000 The depth in metres a bluefin tuna can dive . 90 The percentage decline in bluefin tuna numbers in the Atlantic due to over-fishing . 21 The maximum length in feet of adult fish . 30 The maximum age of an adult fish . 8 The age at which they reach sexual maturity .

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- Jaycee Dugard, who police say was kidnapped at 11 and held captive for 18 years, said she is \"doing well\" as she speaks out in a new home video. \"Hi, I\\'m Jaycee. I want to thank you for your support, and I\\'m doing well,\" Dugard says in the video released exclusively to ABC News, which posted excerpts of the video on its Web site Friday. \"It\\'s been a long haul,\" said Dugard, \"but I\\'m getting there.\" The full statement and video, which show Dugard baking cookies with her mother and playing with her dogs, were scheduled to air on ABC News\\' \"20/20\" at 9 p.m. Friday. It\\'s the first public statement from Dugard since the arrests of her suspected captors -- Phillip Garrido, 58, and his wife, Nancy, 54. The Garridos are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard, who was 11 when she was snatched from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California. She was 29 when found in August at the Garridos\\' home in Antioch, California, about 120 miles from her home. Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Authorities say he and his wife held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years. The Garridos have pleaded not guilty. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard\\'s two daughters. \"We released this video so that you can see that we are happy and well -- when we have more to share, we will,\" Probyn says in the home video. \"As a mother I am pleading for our privacy in this very public story.\" Authorities maintain Dugard does not want to speak to Garrido or his attorneys and have tried to keep her location a secret.',\n",

       " {'article': \"A girl aged nine has become the youngest victim of the NekNomination drinking craze. Rhiannon Scully was hospitalised after downing a cocktail of vodka and whisky, egged on by her friends who had seen similar stunts on Facebook. She was found riding home ‘all over the place’ on her electric scooter and still in her school uniform by her horrified mother, who picked her up and called\\xa0 an ambulance. Rhiannon later had to have her stomach pumped and was monitored overnight in hospital. Scroll down for video . Stomach pumped: Rhiannon recovers in a hospital bed. Her parents released this picture to warn other families of the peril . Yesterday police confirmed they questioned both Rhiannon’s family and her friends’ families about the incident but decided no action was required. Rhiannon’s mother Michelle, 32, claimed the drinking dare was filmed on a mobile but deleted soon after. The alcohol was taken from a cupboard at her friend’s house without the knowledge of any parent. The primary school pupil from Leadgate, County Durham, is the youngest person linked to the deadly drinking game that has now become a global craze and sees people being filmed while performing bizarre challenges. Mrs Scully said she found her daughter with her ‘eyes rolling into the back of her head’ after the drinking dare. NekNomination: Rhiannon Scully's family says children must be taught about the dangers of alcohol in school . She said: ‘When I saw her I was raging, I was upset and angry. I was also scared because we didn’t know what would happen at this point. ‘I saw her in her uniform with two other friends. I ran to her, she was falling over and she didn’t know where she was. She could have been run over, she was riding her scooter at the time.’ The mother said she and her husband Paul, 39, believed Rhiannon had drunk vodka and whisky mixed together with orange juice after being encouraged by her two friends, also aged nine. The unemployed mother said the doctor calculated she had drunk around half a pint of the concoction. ‘Even a fully grown adult would hesitate to mix vodka and whisky,’ she said. ‘She was being sick in the bathroom before the paramedics got there. ‘We found out in the ambulance that it was a NekNomination. Rhiannon said “them stupid NekNominations”.’ She added: ‘I wouldn’t like to see this happen to any other child and I wouldn’t wish the feeling I felt as a parent on my worst enemy. ‘They need to teach children in schools the dangers of alcohol.’ Her husband Paul added: ‘Rhiannon was on a drip all night and had to have her stomach pumped.’ Medics alerted police to the incident last month and the family then received a visit from officers. The NekNominate craze is only thought to have started in January this year in Perth, Australia, but has quickly spread via social media. It is a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on Facebook and other social media sites drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol and then dare their friends to outdo them. An early example of the trend was a woman who was filmed riding a horse into a supermarket before downing a can of Pepsi. But the videos have become increasingly dark with three deaths in Britain now linked to the craze. Last month, in the third death, Bradley Eames, 20, from Nottingham, was found dead after he filmed himself downing almost two pints of gin mixed with teabags. play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .

A few days previously, former grammar school pupil Isaac Richardson, 20, of London, died after telling a friend he wanted to ‘outdo other NekNominate participants before downing a lethal concoction of wine, whisky, vodka and lager. Durham Police said they were also investigating how a 12-year-old required accident and emergency treatment over three consecutive weekends for alcohol-related injuries. Their investigation came after police in Stanley, County Durham, seized a bottle of expensive gin, two bottles of schnapps, two bottles of sparkling wine and eight cans of cider from four 14-year-old girls. Sergeant David Clarke said: ‘Under-age drinking is a severe problem with younger children drinking through peer pressure. Not only did it damage their health, it put them at risk of sexual abuse. ‘There is a very strong link between alcohol and sexual predators. It could just be people who find them in such a state or people who supply them with alcohol in return for sexual favours. It is used as a commodity.’ Hospital staff said they tended to see more under-age drinking in young girls than in boys and expressed their concern at youngsters putting themselves in vulnerable situations.\",\n",

The ladies who took part in the remake of\\xa0Eric Prydz's Call On Me are at various stages of battling cancer . The Norwegian patients and survivors prove that they’re not defined by their illness when they set out to re-enact one of the sexiest music videos ever. The idea was conceived by Aktiv Against Cancer, an organisation that wants people to be active after they are diagnosed with cancer, and after their treatment. Their aim was to demonstrate the positive effect of physical activity on the body and mind. And that no one should let cancer kill their confidence. The organisation believes that physical activity should be a part of cancer treatment. The video ends on the shot of the group's 'dance instructor' walking towards the lone male dancer in the class.

Aktiv Against Cancer was founded by nine-times New York marathon champion Grete Waitz, who after her own diagnosis, joined forces with Helle Aanesen in November 2007 and started the organisation. The group made the video not just to prove that cancer patients and survivors can still be sexy after a diagnosis but also to show that physical activity helps in recovery. The dancers in this video were given training and and then flown to London, where they were taken to the same studio where the original video was shot. One woman who took part in the video said: 'We believe in confidence. That's why we set out to remake one of the most daring music videos ever, starring cancer patients.

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- Four months ago Raya Al Habsi didn\\'t know how to swim and was a complete sailing novice. Yet Al Habsi is set to become one of the first professional women sailors in the sultanate of Oman. Al Habsi is one of 30 women being trained as part of a scheme to create a new generation of female sailors and boost the country\\'s Olympic chances. The women were chosen in July to take part in the program --which started in October-- and will see them qualify as sailing instructors after an intensive six-month training course. For Al Habsi, it has been a life-changing event. \"I didn\\'t know anything about sailing, just what I have watched on TV,\" she says. \"I was a complete beginner.\" \"What I enjoy the most is how every single day we learn something new. It is a breath of fresh air... Oman is such a great place to sail. And I absolutely love racing with my colleagues.\" An insight into the extreme series . Before winning a place on the programme, Al Habsi had recently graduated from a degree in business management. But she was looking for a change and for a career that was unique. She says she found that in the Oman Sail program for women. \"Life has changed a lot since I joined,\" says Al Habsi. \"We start the day laughing and singing and having lots of fun in the bus on our way to sailing school. \"Our daily work schedule differs on a weekly basis. (It) includes theory and practical lessons that help the development of our personal and professional skills.\" It\\'s a pioneering project in Oman, where women have only been able to work since the mid-1990s. Women are now being encouraged by the country\\'s ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, to engage in a range of areas, such as politics and now sailing. Since launching three years ago, Oman Sail has taken nearly 6,000 Omani children sailing, over half of whom have been girls. Young women were recruited into its sailing centers at Mussanah and Marina Bandar Al Rowdha in July, where they underwent training. Al Habsi says, \"We continue the day in developing our fitness levels by swimming, kayaking and, of course, sailing. Sometimes I feel like I\\'m on a trip with my colleagues. I do not feel tired or bored after a long day of work.\" \"We have (been) allowed a golden opportunity for women to go into this field of sailing,\" she says. \"A new challenging field has been introduced for women to take upon the challenge of sailing and represent their country in international venues.\" Double Olympic sailing gold medalist and CNN Mainsail host Shirley Robertson is a mentor on the program. \"When I first went to the marina in July some of these girls didn\\'t know how to swim. \"Some had only seen the sea a few times in their lives. We saw girls sail before but it was hard to retain them in the sport as they grew older because there were no women instructors.\" Considering that many of these women had little experience prior to starting the program, the experience has not been without trials. Robertson adds, \"The journey is amazing. They don\\'t just have to learn to sail. Some have to learn to swim first. At the beginning their fitness levels were low and after the first few weeks they were wrecked... But these girls are thirsty for knowledge.\" Robertson explains that is was an ambitious project that intrigued her from the beginning but she was unsure at first if the organizers would be able to pull it off. \"Oman Sail had to build a pathway and the building blocks had to be laid down right... But they got stuck in. The project has been blessed by the Sultan and Oman Sail has a good reputation in the country so family members feel more comfortable allowing girls to being involved.\" The fact that the project has received a royal blessing is extremely important in the sultanate of Oman. Qaboos bin Said is widely recognized as a reformer in a region where women\\'s rights have traditionally been overlooked. Since coming to power, he has pushed for gender equality in many sectors including politics and education. Al Habsi points out, \"His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said has always emphasized on giving opportunities for Omani women to work in all possible fields shoulder-to-shoulder with their male colleagues.\" Robertson adds, \"Things in Oman are changing. The Sultan embraces women. There\\'s equal education and an Omani Women\\'s Day which was an initiative of the Sultan.\" And while the government has been pushing for an integration of genders, families also need to agree with the project or it is doomed to fail. The family unit is an important institution of many nations like Oman. Robertson says, \"Families are brave to have the love, support and trust to let the women do this. If it\\'s going to work, the whole family has to buy in, especially the men. Jill Reilly contributed to this report .',\n",

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will not use the term war to describe Washington\\'s impending military action against the jihadist group ISIS in Syria and Iraq, but others in the Obama administration aren\\'t shying away from the word. What\\'s in a name? On Wednesday night, the war-stopping, Nobel Peace Prize-winning President used a nationally televised address to announce a plan to \"dismantle and ultimately destroy\" the Sunni jihadists who have taunted America by beheading two captive U.S. journalists. \"We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,\" he said. \"That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq.\" The administration, of course, prefers the term ISIL while many others go with ISIS, but that\\'s another story. The seeds of uncertainly over what to call the ISIS-ISIL campaign were planted by Kerry on Thursday, who told CNN in an interview that the United States was not at war with ISIS, saying the administration\\'s strategy includes \"many different things that one doesn\\'t think of normally in context of war.\" \"What we are doing is engaging in a very significant counterterrorism operation,\" Kerry told CNN\\'s Elise Labott in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. \"It\\'s going to go on for some period of time. If somebody wants to think about it as being a war with ISIL, they can do so, but the fact is it\\'s a major counterterrorism operation that will have many different moving parts.\" On Thursday, Deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf sought to clarify the lexicon of the anti-ISIS campaign. \"Well, I know there has been a lot of questions about what words we use but as the president said the other night this is a very different campaign from the Iraq War, the last time we used that term,\" she said. \"It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. We utilize our air superiority and support for partner forces on the ground.\" Instead, she calls the action \"a steady, relentless counterterrorism campaign to take out ISIL wherever they exist.\" \"This is not also America\\'s war with ISIL,\" she added. \"The world is joining us in the fight because of the threat they pose to countries in the regions. So we are at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates around the world.\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Friday said it was ISIL that had \"indicated that they are ready to go to war against the world and this president, as is expected of American presidents, is stepping up to lead an international coalition to confront that threat.\" He added, \"Ultimately, this international coalition will be responsible for degrading and destroying ISIL. So I think what you can conclude from this is the United States is at war with ISIL the same way that we are at war with al Qaeda and al Qaeda affiliates all around the globe.\" The Pentagon had a similar take. The United States is at war with ISIL \"in the same way we\\'re at war and continue to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates,\" press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. \"There\\'s not going to be a purely military solution to the threat that ISIL poses in the region, specifically inside Iraq,\" Kirby said. \"There\\'s not going to be a military solution here.\"',\n",

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- For three months, Mark Cherry lay in a Chicago-area hospital room, close to death. He suffered a gunshot wound during a home invasion in Gary, Indiana -- a crime he is accused of committing, and in which he allegedly shot and killed a 22-year old man. In late February, fully recovered, Cherry discharged himself and walked out of the hospital. Now, the victim\\'s family is questioning how an accused killer could just leave, with no one stopping him. Law enforcement and the hospital are blaming each other for the mix-up. And Cherry is still on the run. \"Why wasn\\'t he handcuffed? Why didn\\'t you have a police officer at the door waiting for him to get released?\" Lourdes deJesus Correa, mother of the victim, Rolando Correa, told CNN affiliate WLS Tuesday. The home invasion . Lourdes Correa\\'s son was killed more than five months ago. Just before midnight on December 1, Cherry and two other men allegedly forced their way into a home where Rolando Correa was staying. At some point during the home invasion, shots were fired and Cherry allegedly shot and killed Rolando Correa, Gary Police spokeswoman Cpl. Gabrielle King told CNN. Cherry was also wounded and transported to a local hospital, and then airlifted across state lines to a hospital in Illinois, she said. That same month, Cherry was charged with murder, attempted murder, criminal confinement, and battery with a deadly weapon. At Advocate Christ Medical Center, Cherry recovered but was apparently not under police guard during his hospital stay. The hospital told CNN it can\\'t hold a patient against their will, and that without prior written consent, can\\'t alert another person of a patient\\'s pending discharge. Privacy laws are in place to prevent that type of information from being shared, a hospital spokesman said. \"If a patient is under suspicion for a serious offense, the police department involved in the case typically posts an officer on site during the period of the hospitalization,\" the hospital said. Gary police say that they have no jurisdiction in Illinois, and that prevented them from having someone guarding Cherry. \"I don\\'t know what a better scenario would be,\" King, the police spokeswoman, said, adding that \"we really don\\'t know who is responsible\" for Cherry slipping through the cracks. Gary police could have asked the Cook County Sheriff\\'s Office in Illinois to monitor the suspect. That wasn\\'t done. \"Unfortunately, our investigators assumed because he was unconscious that the hospital would give the detective a call before he was released,\" Chief Wade Ingram told WLS. Police are searching for the murder suspect, though there are few clues other than he was discharged from the hospital, King said. It\\'s an emotional blow for a family that\\'s already lost so much. \"It\\'s like our whole family is falling apart due to this. We are falling apart,\" Lourdes deJesus Correa said. \"Please, I just want justice for my son. For my family. That\\'s all I want.\"',\n",

The calculation improves astronomers' knowledge of Saturn's orbit and could allow Nasa to better navigate its probes through space. Scroll down for video . Saturn and its moons may be nearly a billion miles away, but scientists now say they can pinpoint their location to within just two miles (4 km) after using data from the\\xa0Very Long Baseline Array and the Cassini probe . Known as the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), the antenna assembly used signals sent by the Cassini probe to exactly monitor the position of the gas giant. They combined this data with information about Cassini's orbit from Nasa's Deep Space Network. The combined observations allowed the scientists to make the most accurate determinations yet of the position of the centre of mass, or barycentre, of Saturn and its numerous moons. Nasa claims the measurement is some 50 times more precise than those provided by ground-based optical telescopes. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) antenna assembly used signals sent by the Cassini probe to exactly monitor the position of the gas giant. Pictured are the location of the ten sites . Nasa claims the measurement of Saturn and its moons using its new method is now some 50 times more precise than those provided by ground-based optical telescopes. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) is a system of ten radio-telescope antennas,each with a dish 82ft (25 metres) in diameter and weighing 240 tonnes. From Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii to St Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the VLBA spans more than 5,000 miles (8,000 km), providing astronomers with the sharpest vision of any telescope on Earth or in space. Dedicated in 1993, the VLBA has an ability to see fine detail equivalent to being able to stand in New York and read a newspaper in Los Angeles. Source:\\xa0National Radio\\xa0Astronomy Observatory . 'This work is a great step toward tying together our understanding of the orbits of the outer planets of our solar system and those of the inner planets,' said Dayton Jones of JPL, who led the study. The improved accuracy will help enhance precise navigation of interplanetary spacecraft and help refine measurements of the masses of solar system objects. It will also improve predictions of when Saturn or its rings will pass in front of background stars -- events that provide a variety of research opportunities for astronomers. Previously, the navigators performed their own estimates of the positions of Saturn and its satellites using data gleaned by tracking Cassini's radio signal during its communications with Earth. The new calculations, enhanced by VLBA data, are about 20 times more accurate. Professor Jones and colleagues plan to continue the joint observations with Cassini and the VLBA through the end of Cassini's mission in late 2017. The team will also use similar techniques to observe the motion of Nasa's Juno spacecraft when it reaches Jupiter in mid-2016. The findings were reported at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle.

Researchers from the UK and Italy clam to have found indications that dark matter, the cosmic scaffolding on which the universe is built, is being slowly erased by dark energy. They claim the latest astronomical data favours a dark energy that grows as it interacts with dark matter, and this appears to be stunting the growth of structure in the cosmos. A mysterious dark energy could be swallowing up the universe to leave a 'big, empty, boring' place. Researchers from the UK and Italy clam to have found indications that dark matter, the cosmic scaffolding on which the universe is built, is being slowly erased by dark energy (artist's impression pictured) 'This study is about the fundamental properties of space-time,' said Professor David Wands, director of Portsmouth's Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation. 'On a cosmic scale, this is about our universe and its fate.' 'If the dark energy is growing and dark matter is evaporating we will end up with a big, empty, boring universe with almost nothing in it. Dark matter provides a framework for structures to grow in the universe. Meanwhile, dark energy is a mysterious substance that is thought to be pushing the universe apart. 'The galaxies we see are built on that scaffolding and what we are seeing here, in these findings, suggests that dark matter is evaporating, slowing that growth of structure.' Scientists claim the latest astronomical data favours a dark energy that grows as it interacts with dark matter, and appears to be stunting the growth of structure in the cosmos. Pictured is a Hubble Space Telescope composite image of evidence for a dark matter ring in galaxy cluster CI0024+17 . Dark energy\\xa0can be observed in models that show how the universe expands. But no one knows exactly what it is.\\xa0One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. Another suggests that dark energy comes from the quantum theory of matter. In this theory, 'empty space' is full of temporary particles that continually form and then disappear. Scientists believe roughly 68 per cent of the Universe is dark energy and dark matter makes up about 27 per cent. The rest - everything on Earth and all normal matter - adds up to less than five per cent of the universe. Dark matter\\xa0surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. Scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. Professor Wands said cosmology underwent a paradigm shift in 1998 when researchers announced that the rate at which the universe was expanding was accelerating. The idea of a constant dark energy throughout space-time - or the 'cosmological constant' - became the standard model of cosmology. But researchers at the universities of Portsmouth and Rome believe they have found a better description, including energy transfer between dark energy and dark matter. He said: 'Since the late 1990s astronomers have been convinced that something is causing the expansion of our universe to accelerate. The simplest explanation was that empty space - the vacuum - had an energy density that was a cosmological constant. 'However there is growing evidence that this simple model cannot explain the full range of astronomical data researchers now have access to. 'In particular the growth of cosmic structure, galaxies and clusters of galaxies seems to be slower than expected.' Professor Dragan Huterer, of the University of Michigan, said: 'The paper does look very interesting. 'Any time there is a new development in the dark energy sector we need to take notice since so little is understood about it. 'I would not say, however, that I am surprised at the results, that they come out different than in the simplest model with no interactions. 'We've known for some months now that there is some problem in all data fitting perfectly to the standard simplest model.' 'This study is about the fundamental properties of space-time,' said Professor David Wands at Portsmouth University. 'On a cosmic scale, this is about our universe and its fate. If the dark energy is growing and dark matter is evaporating we will end up with a big, empty, boring universe with almost nothing in it'\",\n",

       " {'article': \"Marie McKinlay, 40, pictured arriving at court, is alleged to have run a high-class escort agency called Allure . A brothel madam used the profits from her £500,000-a-year business to put her two children through private school, a court heard yesterday. Marie McKinlay allegedly employed 25 high-class prostitutes able to offer clients everything from ‘girlfriend experience to porn star experience’. They charged as much as £300 an hour and £1,500 for overnight bookings that had to ‘include some sleep’. McKinlay’s online escort agency was no more than a front for a prostitution racket, London’s Southwark Crown Court was told. The 40-year-old rented a £1,500-a-month apartment in central London where clients could romp with two girls from a roster with names such as ‘Sophie Sweetness’ and ‘Beth Angel’. She is said to have made more than £350,000 in profits from the racket in three years. When the officers who arrested her told her what her earnings were she claimed to be shocked but said the money had ‘put two of her children through private school and paid her £1,500 monthly rent’. Edmund Vickers, prosecuting, said: ‘Marie McKinlay ran an internet escort agency which provide prostitutes at what could be described as the high end of the market, the expensive end, for clients who were willing to pay £300 or more an hour for sexual services. ‘She interviewed and recruited the girls, she uploaded their details to the website – not only their photos but the services\\xa0 that each girl offered and their prices – she dealt with the clients, and she organised the girls’ bookings. ‘She charged the girls 30 per cent commission on all the takings, which made her a small fortune. ‘In less than two-and-a-half years between December 2008 and May 2011, when one looks at her bank account, one can see she received cash deposits totalling something over £350,000. 'You will see that when the defendant was arrested, for the period from January to June 2011, she had already made over £90,000.’ Voyeurism: At Southwark Crown Court (pictured), Parsons also admitted to making or possessing 61 indecent photographs and distributing one image of children between four and ten-years-old . When McKinlay was detained at her . home in Southampton in July 2011 police seized a diary which recorded . ‘the names of the working girls and the amounts owed by each girl for . each day of the year’. In interview in December 2011 . McKinlay admitted setting up the agency and said her ‘ambition’ was that . it should become ‘a top or elite agency’ and that she had 25 girls on . her books. She admitted to officers that she had . rented the flat in London Bridge but had been forced to cancel the . contract in August 2010 as ‘the girls had used it for too many late . night parties’. Mr Vickers added: ‘The defendant was . responsible for putting in services provided by each of the girls that . could range from French kissing to what is described as girlfriend . experience to porn star experience. ‘The Crown say there can be no doubt that this was prostitution and that the defendant was controlling it.’ McKinlay, of Lewisham in South-East London, denies controlling prostitution for gain and converting criminal property. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\",\n",

       " {'article': \"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . TV presenter Noel Edmonds is preparing to buy the BBC with the backing of a group of wealthy investors to save it from ‘inevitable disaster’, he claimed yesterday. The former BBC star – who now hosts Deal or No Deal on Channel 4 – said renewing the corporation’s current licence fee agreement would be ‘as futile as giving medicine to a corpse.’ Instead, he wants to turn it into a not-for-profit broadcaster run along commercial lines and slim down its ‘bloated’ bureaucracy. Noel Edmonds rose to fame when he started out as a DJ on BBC Radio 1 - but now he has his sights set on a promotion after he has said that he would now like to part-own the corporation . The 65-year-old said he has assembled a group of rich backers under the name Project Reith, after the corporation’s first director general Lord Reith. He insisted they ‘could and would pay’ the market price of the BBC, as calculated by a team of advisers and former BBC executives. He said that finding the money to buy the corporation would not be a problem.’ Writing in The Sunday Times, Mr Edmonds said that he had meetings with business people across the globe and they all believed that a business model could be found to save the BBC. He said: ‘Believe me, these people can make it happen. If ailing British companies such as Rolls-Royce, Land Rover, British Airways and Cadbury can be turned around, there is still hope for the BBC.’ Mr Edmonds first found fame on BBC Radio 1 before hosting TV shows including Top Of The Pops and Noel's Hose Party. But he quit in 1999, publicly criticising the corporation’s management culture. In the past, he has refused to pay the licence fee in protest at the ‘threatening’ way in which it is collected. Yesterday, the star claimed the BBC could face a mass ‘licence fee revolt’ and could collapse if just five per cent of households refused to pay the £145.50 annual charge. Noel Edmonds blasted the 'bloated bureaucracy' at the BBC but said that there is still hope for the organisation . He said that he believes people 'deserve better' than the current organisation. 'BBC management has pursued an expansionist strategy that defies logic and the founding laws of commerce,' he said. He blasted the organisation for purchasing new buildings rather than focusing on quality television. My Edmonds declined to say how much it would cost to buy out the BBC, although experts have said its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, is worth about £2billion alone. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Long-term polling shows that the licence fee is the funding method with single most backing and it’s been rising. ‘Support for the licence fee is at 53% - way ahead of subscription and advertising. It’s the top choice for funding the BBC across all ages, classes and whether you are in a Freeview, Virgin or Sky household.’\",\n",

The Washington Post is ending 80 years of being led by the Graham family with the departure of Publisher Katharine Weymouth. The newspaper said Tuesday that Weymouth, the granddaughter of longtime Washington Post Co. CEO Katharine Graham, is stepping down. She will be replaced by Frederick Ryan, who previously ran the political website and newspaper Politico. Weymouth announced Tuesday that she will leave the Post after serving for 17 years in various roles. She has been publisher for seven years. New publisher: Frederick Ryan, seen in this 2012 file photo, will become publisher of The Washington Post starting October 1 . 'This is just the beginning of a wonderful new chapter for The Post,' she said in a statement. She also described her successor as 'a seasoned and well-respected executive with a track record of success at the helm of Politico and Allbritton Communications. He knows Washington, and he knows media. Fred is excited to take the helm and to meet all of you.' Weymer's statement said Ryan will become publisher October 1, though she revealed 'I will remain available as an advisor to him and to The Post through the end of the year.' The change follows the sale of the publication last year to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million. On Tuesday, Bezos announced the appointment of Ryan as the new publisher. Ryan had served as president and CEO of Politico since its inception in 2007. In the 1980s, Ryan was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. In a statement, Ryan called The Post a 'crown jewel' of journalistic values. Stepping down: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, left, bought The Washington Post for $250 million last year.

But I will say, I’ve known Jeff for a while. He is passionate about The Post and about journalism and about the premier role The Post has played and can play going forward. 'And we had a lot of exciting conversations about opportunities that are available in media today, challenges of course, innovative ways forward. And I was honored that he selected me to take on this role. '[Ryan] has never asked us to do or not do a story,' Bill Lord, Ryan's colleague at Albritton Communications, told The Post. 'He’s never tried to influence the news one way or another.' Politico, which is based in Arlington, Va., was launched by two former Washington Post reporters, John Harris and Jim VandeHei, in January 2007. It is known for hard-hitting, sometimes irreverent reporting on campaigns, rhetoric and scandal, and is one of The Washington Post's strongest competitors. Weymouth's great-grandfather, Eugene Meyer, bought the Post at a bankruptcy auction in 1933. Meyer's daughter, Katharine Graham, oversaw the paper through some of its most important stories, including the Watergate scandal.\",\n",

The cake is decorated with red icing plus several Chevrolet logos in a nod to the club's home kit for the 2013-14 season.

With its girlish gossiping about handsome men and parties, it is a classic example of an exchange between young women. The writer talks of her heart ‘fluttering’ at the sight of a ‘devastatingly attractive young giant’ of an officer, and her embarrassment at busybodies listening in on her chat at parties. But the signature at the bottom, ‘Lilibet’, gives a clue that it was not written by any ordinary young woman. Carefree: A series of items, including Royal letters written by a young Princess Elizabeth, have been released. Left, Princess Elizabeth dances with a friend in 1946. Right, the Princess in a lemon gown, with diamonds in her ears and around her neck, dances with Commander S Either at the Phoenicia Hotel in Malta in 1951 . The author was none other than Princess Elizabeth, writing at the tender age of 19 in the months following the end of the Second World War – only seven years before she would become queen. The carefree tone of the note, to her ‘darling’ cousin Diana Bowes-Lyon, is in stark contrast to the gravity of the role fate was preparing for Elizabeth. Lilibet – then her pet name among the family – writes excitably about dances, weddings and men, saying she has not been ‘doing badly in the way of fun’ and has been ‘greedily’ taking opportunities to socialise at Balmoral. Inner thoughts: The signature at the bottom of the letter 'Lilibet' reveal the identity of its author . She reveals that one of the Royal family’s protection officers is ‘a devastatingly attractive young giant (with fair hair and blue eyes, of course) from Skye called Roddy Macleod!’ She adds: ‘He caused my Margaret’s (her sister) heart to flutter a bit, I think (mine too, a bit).’ To her cousin, who was in Germany working with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry for the Army when Elizabeth wrote the letter in November 1945, she notes that ‘you must have fun with all your Generals’ and have ‘made the acquaintance of a good many of the species’. The letter, on six sides of Buckingham Palace-headed notepaper, has come to light as part of a sale of about 400 items related to Europe’s Royal children, to commemorate the birth of Prince George, called Two Centuries of Royal Children. Elizabeth also gossips about the wedding between Johnny, 4th Earl of Kimberley and Diana Legh, saying it was ‘a tremendous affair'. ‘There must have been at least 500 people. It became so packed that one couldn’t move without some horrid old lady listening to what one said to every man one met!’ At the time, the young princess had already fallen for Philip, whom she would marry two years later. But she seemed to still have half an eye on plenty of other young men. Taking a more serious tone, Elizabeth says that with her cousin in ‘a place like Germany, one is grateful for any small thing, and when one thinks of how much one grumbles back here, then we all ought to be ashamed of ourselves’. She also bemoans the fact her friends keep being posted overseas: ‘It’s a great pity so many people who one just got to know have all departed for Palestine or Germany, so one has got to begin all over again.’ Sombre: Appearances suggest not all of the young princess' encounters were an emotional roller coaster. Right, pictured with Capt Humphreys at the Dorchester Hotel in 1946. Left,\\xa0 the Princess dances a slow fox trot with Lord Provost Sir Victor Warren in Glasgow . Charming: Left, Princess Elizabeth and her dancing partner Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1951. Right, Princess Elizabeth dancing with Lord Leveson at the Flower Ball at the Savoy Hotel . The sale also features two earlier letters from an even younger Princess Elizabeth.

Ben Patrick told the newspaper police fired at the man as his back was turned. 'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or tase him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.' Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said. 'All he was trying to do was walk away.' Other witnesses heard officers give the man orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen. Metzger has identified the three officers involved in the shooting. They were placed on leave for the investigation, a standard practice. The Tri-City Special Investigation Unit, which will not include Pasco police, will investigate. Investigators are looking at cellphone video of the scene that has been posted online. Carlos Sanchez, who witnessed the shooting from the grocery store parking lot, also said it looked like the man was running away from officers when he was killed. 'They started shooting and they kept on shooting him,' he said. The case is the fourth fatal shooting involving a Tri-City police officer in Pasco in the last six months. Officers have been cleared of any wrongdoing in all three previous cases.\",\n",

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo won his 99th international cap for Portugal -- but the Real Madrid superstar could not inspire his country as it slumped to a World Cup qualifying defeat in Russia. Only Luis Figo (127) and Fernando Couto (110) have made more appearances for Portugal than Ronaldo, who will hope to reach his century against Northern Ireland on Tuesday. Ronaldo had scored eight goals in his previous three games for Real Madrid, including a classy double against Barcelona in last Sunday\\'s El Clasico. Messi and Ronaldo ensure honors shared in 222nd El Clasico . But he was unable to prevent Russia from claiming a third consecutive victory in Group F to claim top spot as Fabio Capello\\'s men recorded a 1-0 win. Alexander Kerzhakov\\'s sixth minute strike was enough to secure Russia its first ever win over Portugal in the post-Soviet era. Playing on the synthetic surface at Moscow\\'s Luzhniki Arena, Portugal struggled to make a breakthrough against a stubborn Russian defense. Russian keeper Igor Akinfeyev made two impressive saves to deny Ronaldo and Bruno Alves as the visitors pushed for an equalizer. But the home side held out and might have even extended their lead further had Denos Glushakov and Roman Shirokov made the most of their opportunities. \"I can\\'t say that we looked bad tonight,\" Portugal manager Paulo Bento told AFP. \"In general we played a good match. We reacted well on the goal we conceded and we followed the plan which we worked out before the match. \"Of course Russia played a great match but I think the result wasn\\'t fair as I know my team is capable of playing top quality football. We came here to win and are really upset now.\" FIFA Asia chief: 2022 Winter World Cup would \\'make sense\\' Germany underlined its credentials as potential World Cup winners with a 6-1 thrashing of the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. The defeat, Ireland\\'s heaviest at home since 1931, came with the hosts missing several key players including captain Robbie Keane. Marco Reus scored twice in eight minutes to give the Germans a 2-0 lead at the break, before goals from Mesut Ozil, Miroslav Klose and two Toni Kroos strikes left Ireland decimated. Andy Keogh grabbed a consolation for Ireland but that failed to tarnish a Germany performance which sees them top Group C with maximum points. Germany has not lost a World Cup qualifier in its past 16 matches with its last defeat coming against England in September 2001. World and European champions Spain eased to a 4-0 win in Belarus courtesy of a hat-trick from Barcelona\\'s Pedro.

Wayne Rooney moved up to fifth place in the list of England\\'s all-time leading goalscorers after netting twice in a 5-0 win against minnows San Marino. Rooney, who took his tally to 31 goals for his country, scored a goal in each half with his Manchester United teammate Danny Welbeck also notching twice. \"There are some great players there and to be in the England top five is something to be proud of,\" he told ITV1. \"I am only 26 so hopefully I will score a lot more. \"We created some good chances and maybe there was a bit of poor finishing but it\\'s not that easy when they put 10 or 11 men behind the ball. \"It\\'s difficult to break them down and we had to create chances and we managed to do that, so obviously we\\'ll take the positives and it wasn\\'t a bad result.\" Arsenal\\'s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain grabbed his first international goal to complete a routine win over a San Marino side ranked 207th out of 207 in the world rankings.

       " {'article': 'Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai ordered the arrest Monday of the Taliban who participated in the public execution of a woman accused of adultery. Shock and outrage have mounted since an amateur video surfaced of a burqa-clad woman sitting on the ground while a man standing a few feet away shoots her nine times before a cheering mob. The execution raises questions about what the 2014 withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan will mean for women, who regained basic rights of education and voting after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Karzai condemned the killing and ordered security officials to arrest and punish those involved, according to a statement released by the president\\'s press office. Saving Face: The struggle and survival of Afghan women . Officials in Afghanistan, where the amateur video was taken, believe the woman was executed because two Taliban commanders had a dispute over her, according to the governor of the province where the killing took place. Both apparently had some kind of relationship with the woman, Parwan province Gov. Abdul Basir Salangi said. To save face, they accused her of adultery, Salangi told CNN on Sunday. Then they \"faked a court to decide about the fate of this woman and in one hour, they executed the woman,\" he added. Both Taliban commanders were subsequently killed by a third Taliban commander, Salangi said. Karzai called on officials to track down everyone involved, including those in the video. \"We went there to investigate, and we are still looking for people who were involved in this brutal act,\" he said Sunday. U.S. Marine Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, said he was encouraged by reports that provincial police were \"investigating the circumstances surrounding this atrocity.\" He also offered the assistance of NATO troops to track down those responsible for the killing, according to a statement released by the U.S.-lead International Security Assistance Force. 6 American troops killed in Afghanistan IED attack . The killing took place in the village of Qimchok in Shinwari district, just north of the capital of Kabul. Karzai described those involved in the shooting death as \"cowards,\" saying \"such crimes are unforgivable both in Islam and under our country\\'s laws,\" the statement from his press office said. The United States condemned the killing \"in the strongest possible terms,\" calling it a \"cold-blooded murder.\" \"The protection of women\\'s rights is critical around the world, but especially in Afghanistan, where such rights were ignored, attacked and eroded under Taliban rule,\" the American Embassy said in a statement Sunday. The public execution is the latest and among the most shocking examples of violence against women in Afghanistan, but it is far from an isolated case. Hundreds of students and teachers at girls\\' schools in the country have been hospitalized with suspected poisoning this year alone. Girls were forbidden to go to school when the Taliban ruled the country from 1996 to 2001. Nearly nine out of 10 women suffer physical, sexual or psychological violence or forced marriage at least once in their lifetimes, Human Rights Watch said in its 2012 annual report.

       " {'article': \"By . Associated Press . A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court’s ruling that a disgraced Detroit judge cannot be sued by a defendant in a child support case he presided over. The decision dated Monday by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati cites existing U.S. Supreme Court law that Wade McCree is immune from lawsuits stemming from judicial actions. Robert King had claimed that the former Wayne County Circuit Court judge violated his civil rights. Shielded: A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's ruling that disgraced judge Wade McCree cannot be sued by a defendant in a child support case he presided over . Illicit affair: Geniene La'Shay Mott had a child-support case pending in McCree's court and disclosed their affair in December 2013 . The married McCree had a sexual relationship with Geniene La’Shay Mott while presiding over a 2012 child support case between her and King. Some of the trysts took place in McCree’s chambers. According to the Detroit Free Press, McCree sexted Mott from the bench and gave her thousands of dollars. Courts have long prevented judges being sued by litigants for their decisions, but King's attorney Joel Sklar says McCree used his judicial immunity 'as a shield for self interest.' 'There should be no immunity for what happened here,' said Sklar. He is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court for help in challenging the doctrine that judges can't be sued for their court decisions. Sexting scandal: McCree allegedly sexted Mott from the bench during the proceedings . Brian Einhorn, McCree's attorney, says his client's decision to tether King and order him to pay child support was the appropriate one.'In our system, people are going to be unhappy when a judge renders a decision. And if a judge can be sued because the decision they made — in someone’s opinion — was right, wrong or unfair, then our system of justice doesn’t work,' Einhorn said, reports the Detroit Free Press.King says McCree found favorably for his ex-wife because of his 'desires for sexual gratifications.'THe court, while ruling that McCree cannot be sued by King, called McCree's actions 'often reprehensible.'Michigan’s Supreme Court in March ordered McCree removed from office and suspended him for six more years if he’s re-elected in November.The Detroit Free Press reports that McCree's father, Wade Hampton McCree, Jr was the first black person appointed to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appleals and the second black solicitor general in the U.S.\",\n",

Allergic: Emma, a talented artist who attended Xaverian College, in Rusholme, Manchester had been warned that a single nut could kill her . A teenage girl died after having a massive allergic reaction to the nuts in a takeaway curry, an inquest heard. Emma Egerton took only one mouthful of the chicken tikka korma before the reaction set in. The student, 18, who was alone at the time, had the presence of mind to dial 999 and leave her front door open for the ambulance crews to get in. But, by the time they arrived she was unconscious and she died in hospital that night. The inquest heard there was no warning on the menu that the dish she chose may contain nuts. Yet the korma from the Spice of India restaurant had been cooked in nut oil and contained ground almonds. South Manchester deputy coroner Joanne Kearsley said she was concerned there was no legal requirement – as there is in restaurants – for takeaways to have clear nut warnings. She said: ‘We hear an awful lot about food standards and labels – and despite the fact these signs are required in restaurants, they aren’t in takeaways. 'I intend to write to the Food Standards Agency to highlight the issues in this case.’ Emma, whose father John is a chief inspector with Manchester Police, had been warned that a single nut could kill her when she was diagnosed with the hypersensitivity at the age of five. She was said to be very careful about what she ate and would ask restaurants to cook her meals in separate pans. Closed: Emma was at home on her own, logged onto the Just Eat website and ordered the dish from the Spice of India takeway in Sale . Tragedy struck in November 2010 when she was at home on her own and logged on to the Just Eat website and ordered the dish from the takeaway. Police officers later printed a copy of the website menu which showed there were no nut warnings for the korma. Mohammed Abdul Hannan, owner of Spice of India in Sale, Manchester, said he had repeatedly called the website to ask for nut signs to be put against certain dishes. Just Eat boss David Butress, said putting warning signs next to dishes was ‘not obligatory’ but the website had reviewed its policy. A verdict of accidental death was recorded. No warnings: Miss Egerton ordered the dish from the Just Eat website . Added: A nut allergy symbol has now been added to the Korma section of the website .

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- All the talk this season has been that Robin van Persie is the difference between winning the English Premier League title, or not. Roberto Mancini wanted to sign him after his Manchester City side won a first championship in 44 years on the final day of the 2011-12 campaign. Much to his chagrin, even the deep pockets of the club\\'s Abu Dhabi owners could not tempt the Dutchman. Even worse for the Italian, and for Arsenal fans hoping he would stay in London, the 29-year-old decided to join Manchester United for what has proved to be a bargain initial $34 million. Having never won a title at any of his previous clubs, the striker opted for Old Trafford -- and it has paid off handsomely. His first-half hat-trick in Monday\\'s 3-0 win over struggling Aston Villa clinched a record-extending 20th English crown for United, and put him back on top of the EPL scoring charts. While City\\'s top scorer Carlos Tevez has 11 this season, Van Persie has 24 -- one more than Liverpool\\'s Luis Suarez, who may miss the rest of this season after being charged with violent conduct for biting a Chelsea opponent on Sunday. \"I\\'m very happy but it\\'s weird. I had to wait for so long for my first title and it\\'s a great feeling,\" Van Persie said in a post-match interview after United moved 16 points clear of second-placed City. Two of his goals were set up by 39-year-old Ryan Giggs, who claimed his 13th EPL title since starting his career with United. The second was a spectacular volley following a lofted pass from England striker Wayne Rooney, which virtually ended the game as a contest as early as the 13th minute. \"It was a great ball from Wayne, so the only thing I had to do was guide it right and hit it properly and it went in great,\" said the Netherlands international, whose efforts this season will cost United an extra $2 million in add-on fees. He went 10 games without a goal as United crashed out of the European Champions League, but has bounced back with five in the last three matches. Rooney has had to play second fiddle in the goalscoring stakes, but was able to celebrate his 400th United appearance with an impressive performance from a deeper-lying role. \"It\\'s what we\\'ve worked all year for and we\\'ve fully deserved it. We won this game in the first half and it is a fantastic night for us,\" Rooney said. \"When you lose the title it\\'s hard to take, and the way we did it wasn\\'t a nice feeling last time so we\\'ve all dug in deep and all worked together and done fantastic to put ourselves in the position tonight to finish the job off.\" Last season United blew an eight-point lead before surrendering the title in the final minutes as City snatched an injury-time victory. This season United did not let up, while City dropped points against lesser teams. \"You can go on and on about losing a title but at the end of the day, our consistency for the last 20 years is unbelievable,\" said United manager Alex Ferguson, who has also won 13 titles since joining in 1986. \"The focus of the team was good, they focused on the challenge of City and came up trumps.\" The 71-year-old, the most successful manager since the EPL began in 1992, acknowledged the contribution of Van Persie this season. \"He\\'s been unbelievable, his early form in the first six months was fantastic. He had the spell where he didn\\'t score (for 10 games) but he was unbelievable tonight.\" Ferguson\\'s team can break the EPL points record held by Chelsea with victories in the club\\'s four remaining games. \"We\\'ve now got 84 points with four games left -- we\\'ve never done that,\" he said when asked where this season\\'s achievement ranks. \"We\\'ve won most of our games, drawn three, lost four, and the goal tonight (Van Persie\\'s volley) ... all the great goals we\\'ve scored over the years, from David Beckham through Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Eric Cantona, that goal has joined that. These players have joined the pedestal.\" While the result will likely quell any further protests against United\\'s U.S. owners, the Glazer family -- unpopular after their highly leveraged takeover in 2005 -- the situation is not so positive for another American in charge of an EPL club. The defeat left Randy Lerner\\'s Aston Villa three points above the relegation zone, having played one more match than the third-bottom team, Wigan. Villa manager Paul Lambert was relieved his side did not suffer a repeat of December\\'s 8-0 defeat at Chelsea, having gone behind after just 90 seconds against United and then trailed 3-0 after 32 minutes. \"We wanted to make sure it didn\\'t happen again. Credit to them they kept on going against a brilliant side, the best in the country,\" Lambert said. \"Congratulations to Man Utd. They have been the best team all season. They work really hard, they work for each other, they have a mentality that has been here for years and years. The best team always wins the league.\"',\n",

       " {'article': \"After the devastating loss of her husband, lonely millionairess Christine Ince thought she had found love again with a younger Gambian man. Aware of the potential pitfalls, the 59-year-old widow spent a year getting to know Mustapha Jabbai, 36, before agreeing to marry him. The mother of three believed his intentions were honourable because he had a permanent job in the UK and had never asked her about her wealth. Better days: Lonely millionairess Christine Ince, 59,\\xa0 thought she had found love again with Mustapha Jabbai, 36, seen here in 2007 . However, shortly after their second anniversary, Mr Jabbai walked out of her £850,000 five-bedroom detached home in the picturesque village of Tilbrook, near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire. Hours later, Mrs Ince discovered their wedding certificate and other documents Mr Jabbai would need to stay in the UK were missing. Worse was to follow. Mr Jabbai then filed for divorce and is demanding the millionairess pay him maintenance and a one-off separation payment and set him up with a pension. In a witness statement for the divorce hearing, Mrs Ince claims the marriage was a ‘sham’ so ‘he could get an indefinite leave to remain visa’. Assets: Christine stands outside her £850,000 five-bedroom detached home in the picturesque village of Tilbrook, near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire . She goes on to accuse Mr Jabbai of bigamy and claims the woman he introduced to her as his sister is actually his Gambian wife Yama Jabbai. Mrs Ince believes he walked out on her just after their two-year anniversary because he had spent long enough married to her to be granted the right to stay in Britain. ‘At the time, I believed he cared for me,’ she said in her statement. ‘I have been made ill by Mustapha’s betrayal of my trust, by his lies and deceit. I feel violated as if I have been raped. ‘It is distressing for me to have lived with someone and to find out I actually know nothing about them. Smiles: Their wedding in December 2007. She met the Gambian, who had a permanent job in the UK, on a dating site . 'He has used me and my commitment to him to gain entry into the UK and [obtain] the legal right to stay here.’ Mrs Ince, a former management accountant, married Bill Ince in 1977 in Chertsey, Surrey. They went on to have three children – Elizabeth, now 31, Charlotte, 29, and Robert, 25. Her husband, a joint-owner of a major tyre company, collapsed at their home in 2003 and died six weeks later, at the age of 63. Mrs Ince went on to have breast cancer but has since recovered. After a tough three years, friends persuaded her to sign up to popular dating website Plenty of Fish. She met Mr Jabbai, who was working for PC World in Reading, on the site and the pair enjoyed a series of dates. Meeting the family: Christine Ince and Mustapha Jabbai at their engagement party in July 2007 . Family ties: Christine Ince with her new husband's family after her wedding to Mustapha on the 6th December 2007 in the Gambia . Mrs Ince told the Daily Mail: ‘Mustapha was different to all the other men I had met through the dating site. ‘He didn’t try to get me into bed straight away and he didn’t ask me about how much money I had, which some men did. 'He . wasn’t a stunning man by any means but he seemed kind and caring. I . know there are guys around who see me as a target because of my wealth. ‘So I checked Mustapha out in lots of ways and with lots of questions. But he never faltered and was so plausible.’ After a year the couple\\xa0 travelled to the city of Brikama in Gambia where they married in front of Mr Jabbai’s family and friends. But when they returned to the UK, Mr Jabbai began to demand money from his new wife, she claims. Experiencing her husband's culture: Christine with Jabbai's family in the Gambia in 2007 . Mrs Ince says she travelled to the visa office in Croydon where she paid £1,000 for his permanent visa. During their two-year marriage, she spent £30,000 on him which he has not repaid, she alleges. ‘After he walked out, I realised what had happened and I felt so foolish and gullible,’ she said. ‘But now I am angry because he is trying to get money from me through the divorce courts. It feels like I am on trial even though I’m the one that has been duped.’ Mr Jabbai left Mrs Ince’s home in March 2010, saying he was going to the dentist. He never returned. Loss: Christine with her late husband Bill Ince in 2001 . First wedding: Christine with her first husband, Bill, on their wedding day in 1977 . The Mail has learned that two months before this, he won the right to permanently stay in the UK. Mr Jabbai, who now lives in Coventry, has denied the accusations in a letter sent by his legal firm Hammon Solicitors to Mrs Ince. When the Mail asked for a response from a man fitting his description at an address registered to Mr Jabbai, he claimed he was someone else.

It might not be the kind of race that United and Liverpool fans are used to, but the battle for fourth spot and Champions League football could come down to the two great rivals. Everton and Tottenham fans might disagree but, despite their ongoing struggles, sooner or later United will go on a run. Seven points is a big gap, but it’s not insurmountable. Liverpool still have to go to Old Trafford and United can turn it around, particularly when Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney combine. There is absolutely no love lost between the clubs, so it will be a real test of nerve. Whatever happens, it will be a game-changer for either side. Roaring success: With Robin van Persie back in action, Manchester United can reach the Champions League . Talisman: Liverpool can keep Luis Suarez (left) if they secure Champions League football . Playmaker: Juan Mata, battling Stoke's Erik Pieters, could be the difference in United's fight for fourth . Liverpool have been without Champions .

Zaha touch map v Norwich . It’s a hard job picking the best signing of the transfer window. We have not seen them all play and some will take time to settle, but you would be hard pressed to find a more exciting player than Wilfried Zaha. He has barely featured for Manchester United, but we are not always privy to what happens on the training ground so can’t say why he’s not been playing. But he is a talent that gets bums off seats. He had an instant impact on Saturday, hugging the touchline, as his pitch map (right) shows, and setting up a goal. In 52 minutes he achieved more than in his two games for United and I’m sure Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will want to unleash him in the Welsh derby on Saturday Night Football. Wing wonder: Wilfried Zaha showed why he is the most exciting signing of the January transfer window . Only a few months ago I was talking to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and he had his knee in a brace. He won’t have felt further from the World Cup, but against Crystal Palace he was back with a bang. Roy Hodgson will see him as a real option now and the good news is there won’t be any worries about him playing too much football and being fatigued. He’s a nice lad and he’ll be chomping at the bit. And don’t forget he knows what it’s like to score in the Maracana... Beaming: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was back with a bang against Palace, celebrating his second goal . Southampton lost form before Christmas but at Fulham, they were back to their best. In Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez they have two of England’s best young players and they were exceptional. Lallana scored from a tight angle while Rodriguez went one better with a superb curling effort. Don’t be surprised if both end up on the plane to Brazil in the summer. Southampton have won 3/3 Premier League games when Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez have both scored . Charlie Adam never really achieved hero status at Liverpool but, with two goals and a win against United on Saturday, I’m sure he will have had the fans on Merseyside smiling. There was more than a touch of fortune about his first goal, which took a huge deflection to beat David de Gea, but there was nothing lucky about his second — it was an absolute screamer right into the top corner. Adam has always had that kind of power in his locker and he unleashed it to devastating effect. I have always been a fan of Adam and his sweet left\\xa0 foot is capable of winning matches. What a way to prove it. Potteries powerhouse: Charlie Adam (left) celebrates with Jon Walters after his stunning goal downed United . Kevin Nolan was back among the goals on Saturday and that is no surprise. Why? Andy Carroll is back. I played against Nolan and he was one of the best players at making late runs to become the third man in attack. He was like a magnet to knock-downs. That’s exactly what he did against Swansea, benefiting from two of Carroll’s headers to score. He had the same relationship with Kevin Davies at Bolton and though the style might not always be appreciated by the West Ham faithful, they will certainly appreciate those goals. Ecstatic: Kevin Nolan was back in the goals on Saturday thanks to Andy Carroll's hold up play . Aerial threat: Nolan benefited from two Carroll headers to give West Ham a priceless victory against Swansea . I watched QPR’s 3-3 draw with Burnley on Saturday lunchtime and it was one of the games of the weekend. There were some excellent performances with plenty of players who would be at home in the Premier League. Burnley’s young right back Kieran Trippier is one of the best passers I’ve seen in his position while Danny Ings underlined his quality with yet another goal. Kevin Doyle made a good debut for QPR and Joey Barton, the league’s best midfielder, was excellent. Just three points separate the sides, so this promotion race could go to the wire.

She had been active in her school's Students Against Drunk Driving chapter and even left a New Year's Party hours before midnight to avoid being in an accident with a drunk driver.

       " {'article': \"By . Nick Enoch and Tamara Cohen . Last updated at 12:40 AM on 23rd February 2012 . The Second World War had been raging for more than two years, with rationing in force and mounting fears of a U-boat blockade. Faced with the prospect of food supplies being cut off, a pair of eminent scientists came up with a solution: Let them eat plankton. They planned to harvest tons of the microscopic creatures from Scottish lochs. Secret wartime letters just uncovered reveal that Professor Alister Hardy, a marine biologist at Hull University, told colleagues that plankton – the term for a range of drifting organisms found in fresh and sea water – were high in protein and could be ‘tasty’. Plans were drawn up to harvest the microscopic sea creatures to sustain Britain if food supplies were cut off during World War Two. The text reads: Fig 1. Sketch of net proposed for full-scale collection of plankton. A is a rope net used to to enable rope B to be pulled inside out. A continuous cable (left) is used to lower or raise the nets to the desired depth. To the right is the line, attached to cork, for hauling up the catch . The idea was to capture tons of copepods - which the scholars described as 'tasty' - in the tidal areas of sea lochs along the west coast of Scotland . He convinced Sir John Graham Kerr, an . MP and regius professor of biology at Glasgow University, and they . calculated that ten nets could catch enough plankton in 12 hours to feed . 357 people. In 1941 Sir John wrote to Richard . Elmhirst, director of the Scottish Association for Marine Science, who . appears to have been sceptical: ‘It is simply silly to brush the matter . aside as of no importance, when one remembers the sea off our coasts is . often soup-like in its richness with nutritive material. The boffins calculated that nets anchored in Loch Fyne would cost £90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton each day. The loch is seen here in 1933 . The academics made diagrams of nets, explored areas on the west coast of Scotland where it could work and even carried out trials from 1941-43 to see if it was possible . ‘No doubt you have tested for yourself the tastiness of some types of plankton.’ Scientists reckoned that nets anchored in . Loch Fyne would cost £90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton . each day. Hardy proposed: 'The plankton would be . emptied into containers and conveyed to the nearest pier where it would stand . ready to be conveyed by lorry or motor boat to the drying plant. 'Simple drying plants would be set up at . convenient points along the coast and the resulting dry plankton dispatched in . sacks to a headquarters factory for testing, sorting, mixing and final . preparation into meal... 'The anchoring and inspection of nets would . be done by motor boats which could also be continually cruising the area . investigating the richest regions of plankton.' Trials went ahead in 1941, 1942 and 1943 but . it was found that the season was too short for the scheme to work. By 1942 the first stockpiles had been . harvested, but the plankton proved trickier to catch than the . scientists expected, and the project was quietly abandoned. The letters were found by Geoffrey . Moore, emeritus professor in marine biology at the University of London, . in the Association’s archive. He said: ‘I know of only one\\xa0 person who has tried plankton and he found it rather fishy\\xa0 and gritty. ‘He wasn’t terribly impressed, but I suppose it would depend on how hungry you were.’ Richard Kirby of the University of . Plymouth, the author of a book about plankton called Ocean Drifters – A . Secret World Beneath the Waves, said the idea of eating plankton is not . so bizarre. Copepods are known as 'the insects of the sea' due to their large numbers. There are believed to be around 10,000 different species. Found in fresh and salt water, they measure no more than a few millimetres long. One species, found in the cold waters off the UK, is the calanus. During winter, it hibernates at a depth of 1,000m to avoid predators - and builds up lipid (fatty) stores in the process. The largest is the Pennella\\xa0 Balaenopterae, which lives on the finback whale and can grow to over a foot long. Copepods are crustaceans - and the largest source of protein in the ocean. They have two antenna, a shell and segmented . bodies and graze on phytoplankton and zooplankton. He added: ‘The Germans had similar plans during the war, and there are still people trying to do this today.’ Prof Moore, who is also president of the . Society for History of Natural History, said he was not surprised at what he . found. He said: 'Marine biologists come up with a . lot of strange ideas. But this scheme was not that odd - there are fisheries . for various plankton in Japan and Scandinavia. 'I've been interested for many years in the . history of marine biology and for the last ten years have been delving into . all sorts of historic marine biology archives. 'When I found these letters, I thought I . would write them up as an academic paper. 'Sir Alister Hardy thought it was a way he . could contribute to the war effort, because he wasn't in the forces himself. 'There was plenty of plankton around, but . there was the question of how easy it would be to catch. You would need a very . large net with a very small mesh. War-time rations in 1944. Plankton was suggested as a back-up food resource . A fish queue in Hammersmith, west London in 1945 . Some societies eat plankton directly. The Japanese dish Okami is made from krill, a shrimp-like plankton . 'There would be the problem of the pressure . of the water trying to push through a net, which would become clogged up with . debris - not to mention basking sharks. 'I only know of one person who has tried . plankton and he found it rather fishy and gritty. Unlike a prawn, which you can . peel, the exoskeleton was still intact. 'He wasn't terribly impressed, but I suppose . it would depend on how hungry you were.

Her most senior official, Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong, set out his ‘increasing disquiet’ about ‘the things that people think are going on in the City’. He said that a ‘bubble’ was being created that would be ‘pricked’ and said that ‘corners were being cut’ and money made in ways ‘that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous’. Scroll down for video . Margaret Thatcher was warned that her financial sector reforms would lead to a new culture of ‘unscrupulous’ practices in the City in the 1980s . Independent regulation was the only solution to the problem, Sir Robert argued. Critics claim that Mrs Thatcher’s reform of the financial sector paved the way for the ‘loadsamoney’ era and the future financial crisis of 2007 which led to economic downturn. The memo came just months before the Big Bang - the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange and its replacement with electronic trading floors and foreign investors. It was so called because the change meant a huge increase in activity and established London as the premier international financial centre and brought huge wealth to City workers. But it was also a period also of financial scandals - most notably the Guinness share-rigging affair which involved an attempt to manipulate the stock market. In an extraordinary memorandum contained in files released by the National Archives in Kew, west London, Sir Robert put down on paper his doubts about the effect the changes were having. Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong set out his ‘increasing disquiet’ about ‘the things that people think are going on in the City’ in a memo to the Prime Minister in March 1986 . Jan 1984: FTSE 100 index of 100 leading shares created, at a base of 1,000 points . Oct 1986: The Big Bang reforms deregulated the stock market, with new technology sweeping aside old trading practices. Banks were able to buy up old stockbroking firms, seeing high street names becoming players on the stock market . 19 Oct 1987: Black Monday sees stock values crash around the world, down almost 11 per cent. The following day the FTSE fell by 12.22 per cent . 30 Dec 1999: \\xa0FTSE peaks at 6950.6, a level not since surpassed . 11 Sep 2001: US terror attacks cause panic around the world and the FTSE falls by almost 6 per cent . 4 Sep 2007: The amount banks lend to each other hits highest level since 1998 . 14 Sep 2007: Northern Rock goes to the Bank of England for a bailout after suffering a run on its money . 15 Sep 2008: Lehman Brothers collapses . 29 Sep 2008: FTSE falls 5.3 per cent after Bradford and Bingley is nationalised . 21 Jan 2008: FTSE slumps 5.5 per cent, wiping £77billion off the value of shares . 13 Oct 2008: UK government orders £37billion bailout of RBS, Lloyds TSB and HBOS . His note, dated March 17 1986, seven months before the Big Bang, was addressed to Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary Nigel Wicks, who would almost certainly have shown it to her. While he acknowledged his concerns were ‘pretty vague and unspecific’, he said that he was by no means alone in harbouring such doubts. ‘I do not know whether you are having the same experience but I am finding, among people who work outside the City of London but whose activities bring them into touch in some degree with the City, that there is increasing disquiet about the things that people think are going on in the City,’ he wrote. ‘I do not just mean the levels of remuneration; a lot of people, including some from inside the City, think that is a bubble that will be pricked in a year or two. ‘They think more about the way in which corners are being cut and money is being made in ways that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous. ‘It tends to be summed up by the people saying that they doubt whether it really is good enough any more to leaving the policing of the City to self-regulation. ‘I’m afraid that all this is pretty vague and unspecific; but I find it sufficiently prevalent to be concerned.’ Mrs Thatcher received an altogether rosier assessment from David Willetts, who was then working in the No 10 policy unit and who co-authored a paper for her on the likely impact of Big Bang. The paper dismissed concerns that it could lead to a repeat of the ‘boom and bust’ which followed previous City deregulation in 1971 when a property boom was followed by a market collapse and a banking crisis. ‘This does not mean that there might not be individual financial failures as a result of bad commercial decisions, but we do not expect a systemic problem,’ the paper noted.',\n",

He said: 'I've spoken to Cara, she says she didn't say that. Blood is thicker than water, so obviously I side with her.' As Arg - who is now dating Gemma Collins - stood by his claims, it wasn't long before the argument reached breaking point. Shouting at his former pal outside the venue, Tom said in a foul-mouthed tirade: 'You're a f***ing mug and you're chatting s**t about my sister.

It was somewhat of a deja vu for Gemma Collins, who got into an angry shouting match with ex-boyfriend Charlie King and their mutual pal Bobby Cole Norris at the gig. After Bobby confessed his love for Charlie last week, the sandwich shop owner was left fuming when he discovered the Gok Wan lookalike had discussed his feelings with Gemma, who had always suggested there was a hint of romance between the pair. A frustrated Charlie said: 'She's trying to dig up the past. I'm trying to get a girlfriend and obviously I can't because there's constant speculation that I'm gay.' But after confronting Gemma about her comments, it spiralled into a huge argument between the threesome. 'You should have spoken to me': Bobby was devastated when Charlie reprimanded him for discussing his feelings with Gemma . Gemma shouted: 'Go and talk to your little boyfriend about it. Bobby has been confiding in me and now you're both ganging up at me. 'You [Bobby] come to me in my flat and confide in me and insinuate that something touchy-feely happened in Marbella. You two are a pair of Jeckylls. Essex is so two-faced.' Elsewhere, the tension between former friends Lucy Mecklenburgh and Sam Faiers continued to bubble, with Sam claiming she had proof the brunette bombshell's fiance, Mario Falcone, had cheated on her with another girl. Angry: Gemma was absolutely fuming when ex-boyfriend Charlie accused her of spreading rumours about him . Argument: Bobby sided with his pal Charlie over Gemma . Lucy fumed to pals Lydia and Danni: 'If she had proof why when I went round to her house, why didn't she give me it then rather than start it all up again? What the f**k? 'The girl is a mutual friend of mine and Mario. She's investigating it to try and prove herself right.' The boutique owner also accused her blonde co-star of stabbing her in the back when over Christmas 2010 she slept with Mark Wright the same day Lucy had split up with him. Lucy added: 'This isn't the first time she's stabbed me in the back. I broke up with Mark Wright and she went home in a cab with him and s*****d him that night. 'She's stabbed me in the back': Lucy confided with Danni and Lydia about the cheating rumours . Trust me: Mario Falcone insisted he had nothing to hide from Lucy . 'That's not a friend. Perhaps I should have drawn a line under it years ago.' And finally Joey Essex went to confront new Essex playboy Jamie Reed after he recently bragged about sleeping with Joey's sister Frankie. He said: 'It's disrespectful. It's upset me, it's upset my family. People have got the hump with you.' After Jamie offered to send Frankie a £50 bouquet of flowers, Joey flew off the handle - insisting only a face to face apology would do, and baffling Jamie with his Essex lingo in the meantime. He fumed: 'I want you to say sorry to her face, she don't want flowers from you. I think you're a bit of a mug. A proper lunchbox, I think you are. Ta-ta.'

A woman was astounded when workmen who came to replace her kitchen floor found a fully plumbed bath tub underneath. Lynette Musgrave had lived in the house in Halifax, West Yorkshire, for 12 years without realising the bath was there. It was not even discovered when she had her laminate flooring replaced a year ago, after her washing machine leaked, because it was covered by concrete. Hidden depths: Lynette Musgrave was shocked when workmen fixing her kitchen floor found a sunken bathtub underneath . It was only when they returned after a second leak made the floor dip in the middle that the fitting was found. And there was a second surprise for Mrs Musgrave when her insurance company said the bath had caused rot damage, which was not covered by them because it pre-dated the start of her policy. She was forced to pawn jewellery and her laptop to raise the £900 needed to replace her floor. 'When they told me they had found a bath tub I couldn’t believe it,' she said. 'I had no idea it was there. 'I’ve had to pay two sets of excess to have the insurance company come out and do the work twice, and now they’re refusing to finish it.' Kitchen calamity: Rosie Kennington had the entire floor cave in when she moved into her new house earlier this year - and her insurance company said she would have to cover the £24,000 herself . Mrs Musgrave said she had suffered stress and lost sleep as a result. 'I’m not looking to get compensation, but I pay building insurance every month and I just want them to replace the floor.' A spokesman for Swinton confirmed that Mrs Musgrave is liable to pay for the damage herself, but that they would refund the £200 increase in her excess as a 'goodwill gesture'. In March, Rosie Kennington and her partner experienced a similar shock after moving into their dream home. Within hours of their arrival, their whole kitchen floor caved in underneath them - and insurance company Direct Line told them they would have to find the £24,000 for repairs themselves.\",\n",

When Obama took office on January 20, 2009, an astounding 78 percent of . Americans said they had positive views of their new president. Meanwhile, a mere 35 percent had nice things to say about outgoing president George W. Bush. Coming . off the precipice of a financial disaster, there was no love lost . between Americans and the Republican president, whose final years in . office brought massive numbers of foreclosures and rampant unemployment. Obama . capitalized on his predecessor's misfortune, and an early strategy of . his administration was to 'blame Bush' for everything that was wrong in . America. Five . and a half years later, it's Obama who is mired in controversy and . fending off critics on both sides of the aisle for sins against America's . veterans and a shady deal with the Taliban that allowed five of its . finest fighters to walk free in exchange for the life of a suspected . deserter from the Army. The . president's signature law, Obamacare, also continues to be a drag on . his ratings, as health care costs continue to increase despite promises . from the president that wouldn't happen. A Bloomberg National Poll released on Wednesday found that 53 percent of Americans are opposed the law. CNN did not specifically ask survey-takers who viewed the president unfavorably why they were upset with him, however respondents have specifically cited Obamacare as area of dissatisfaction in other recent polls, like the the one taken by the Washington Post and ABC News in late April.

CNN also asked poll takers about their opinions of other former presidents and members of their families. No other names on the list drew as much negative attention as Obama and George W. Bush. Former presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush had unfavorable ratings of 31 percent and 33 percent favorable respectively. Of the first ladies, former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was liked the least, with 42 percent giving her a black mark. Michelle Obama came in under Clinton at 34 percent and Barbara Bush and Laura Bush scored poorly with 18 percent and 16 percent of respondents.

       " {'article': \"Campaign: Nigel Farage's Ukip has opened a new headquarters in London ahead of upcoming European elections . Ukip's new London headquarters is a chaotic environment where workers are sex-obsessed and volunteers frequently leave work early to go to the pub, it was claimed today. Former employees say that the office in Mayfair is often full of workers' pets, while staff regularly take their clothes off and compile lists of people they would like to have sex with. Nigel Farage's wife, who works as a secretary for Ukip, has reportedly described the office - which the party moved in to last year as part of its push to become a major political force - as a 'freakshow'. The revelations about the bizarre atmosphere inside the headquarters were revealed after The Times spoke to a number of people who have worked in the building, which is located behind Claridge's hotel. The office, which was lent to Ukip by wealthy backer Andrew Reid, is the centre of the party's push to beat the mainstream parties in this year's European elections, and to win its first MPs in the general election of 2015. However, the insider accounts suggest that the new headquarters have failed to bring about a more professional approach, with one worker describing the atmosphere as 'Carry On politics' where staff are accustomed to ending work early and going to the pub instead. One employee said: 'They are utterly chaotic. I was horrified by them. There's an element of the 70s golf club.' Another added: 'You see the most extraordinary things. Everybody has been out with everybody else. There are animals in the office, people taking their clothes off... there are no sanctions. People are used to doing their own thing.' Chaos: The office, located behind Claridge's, is said to be full of animals and half-naked employees . At one point, workers wrote a list of 'people we want to s**g' on the office whiteboard - including the name of Mr Farage, the party leader who is Ukip's only household name. His wife Kirsten reportedly has to send emails on Mr Farage's behalf, because he does not know how to use a computer and prefers to receive faxes. She has admitted that the office 'takes some getting used to' and privately described the atmosphere as a 'freakshow', according to The Times. A number of figures from the world of business have tried and failed to inject a more professional attitude into the party over the past few years. Chief executive Will Gilpin resigned . last year after just eight months in charge, saying he could not change . Ukip's 'individualistic DNA'. And . millionaire backer Paul Sykes, who is funding the party's election . campaign this year, has set up a parallel operation to avoid giving any . money directly to headquarters. Cheery: Mr Farage has a reputation as a likeable figure but is now trying to professionalise the party . The insider reports come in the wake of a number of embarrassing incidents involving Ukip candidates, most famously when MEP Godfrey Bloom referred to foreign aid recipients as 'bongo bongo land' and described women who fail to clean their homes properly as 'sluts'. It was claimed today . that the party's MEPs were being encouraged to pay a 'tithe' of £10,000 . a year to the party thanks to their 'generous expenses'. Parliamentarians were . allegedly told they had a duty to support Ukip financially, because the . party spends around £125,000 for each successful election. It . was also reported that Ukip MEPs gather for a lavish dinner in . Strasbourg once a month, with staff at the restaurant Pierre Bois et Feu . instructed to produce a special English-themed menu. Ukip director of communications Patrick O'Flynn said: 'I have been in post since the start of February and I have been hugely impressed with the professionalism and dedication of staff at Brooks Mews. 'The Times clearly would prefer Ukip to do very badly at the forthcoming local and European elections. But everyone at Brooks Mews is working flat out to ensure that the opposite occurs. Given the positive response Ukip is getting from the British public, we are very hopeful of achieving an excellent result.'\",\n",

An enthusiastic amateur photographer said he has spent many restless nights and early hours of the mornings - all rugged up with a camera ready on a tripod to do what he loves most - capturing the perfect moments in Canberra ACT. John Hunt said the best times for taking great photographs is early in the morning when everyone is asleep to catch that perfect sunrise. The 57-year-old said his favourite place to shoot his camera is around Lake Burley Griffin, either from land or in his kayak. ‘I love the lake when it's early in the morning because the water is still and there’s no wind,' he said. John Hunt said his favourite place to shoot his camera is around Lake Burley Griffin, either from land or in his kayak at sunset and sunrise . ‘I’ve managed to capture the beautiful mirrored reflection of the lake a few times and it’s been worth getting up early for. 'There are a few monuments around Canberra and I think the most photogenic feature is the Carillon, especially when it is lit up at night. 'I also love taking pictures at night, especially during winter time when it’s dark around 6pm and I’m walking home from work.’ Mr Hunt, who lives in Canberra, purchased his first DSLR camera before he went on a family trip to Europe and China in 2008 but admitted he had no clue how to use it. It was two years ago when he took a professional photography course and not long after, found his love and passion for photography. 'I have been developing my photography skills over the last two and a half years and finally printed one of my own photos to hang on our loungeroom wall,' he said. 'I am really happy with this image of my hometown Canberra and it was taken early this month at the Lake Burley Griffin on a cold gloomy afternoon. 'All rugged up, camera on a tripod, I stood and waited for the perfect moment when the sun radiated it's brilliant red on the clouds.' Mr Hunt said the camera can't always catch what his eyes see in reality so he goes through some editing process. 'For instance, when I take a picture in the sun, it might either be too dark from the shadow or too bright, so I edit the photos to allow others see what I see. 'People say it's cheating but I think it's not. I'm editing my photos the way I want the world to see through my eyes.' When asked what his other styles of photography interests him, Mr Hunt said he is currently learning portrait photography, as well as taking photographs of family events. ‘My son got married in May this year and I took my camera to his wedding to take some photographs and everyone told me I did a good job.' Mr Hunt said he will be going on a holiday with his wife Joanne to South Island, New Zealand at the end of September. 'I'm really excited about it and I cannot want to take my camera over there to take beautiful pictures of where we'll be staying,' he said. Despite all his beautiful photography work, Mr Hunt owned a plumbing business for 25 years and he's onto his 40th year as a plumber. He also teaches plumbing at the Canberra Institute of Technology.

With his weight and body fat ratio unchanged since he was 17, Cahill said he would be looking for a two or three year contract when his deal with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls expires next year. The 35-year-old, in Australia to prepare for next month's Asian Cup, said he could yet return to the English Premier League, where he spent nine years with Everton before making the switch stateside. Tim Cahill (centre) interacts with fans during the launch of the Football Fan Park in Sydney on Saturday . Cahill poses with the Asian cup mascot Nutmeg at Sydney's Customs House during the weekend . 'The future's bright,' Cahill told the Australian Associated Press. 'I've got another year left on my New York Red Bulls contract. The main feeling for me is every time I'm at a club, I like to be there for a long time. 'To be totally honest, I could have gone back to the Premier League on loan after the World Cup and I decided to stay with Red Bulls for the remainder of the season and still (have) options to go back to the Premier League if it's the right one for me.

Cahill signs an Australia shirt for a young fan in Sydney ahead of next month's Asian Cup . Playing for his country, for whom he has scored at the last three World Cup and 36 goals in total, remains a key factor in his considerations over where to play.

I average 30 or 40 games every season since I was 17 years old and nothing's changed.'

The host nation will be looking to Cahill for a good few more from January 9-31 as the Socceroos look to win Asia's biggest tournament for the first time at the third attempt.

       " {'article': 'By . Victoria Woollaston . Nowadays, gadgets and equipment are becoming increasingly complex and technical, but scientists have proved when it comes to microscopy - less is more. Foldscope is an origami-based print-and-fold optical microscope that can be assembled from a single sheet of paper. There are 30 versions, each built with varying filters and stage configurations designed to look for specific diseases, such as malaria. The Foldscope, pictured, was created by Stanford University and all the components and lenses are embedded into a single sheet of paper. The 30 versions are each built with varying filters and stage configurations, designed to look for specific diseases, such as malaria . A designer recently created a $10 (£6) DIY microscope using wood, glass and a smartphone. By fitting a block of wood with a plate of plexiglass and the lens from a laser pointer, the design lets users make a microscope with 175x magnification for an iPhone. Once the project is completed, the smartphone can be used to take photos of things as small as the nuclei of plant cells as well as for macro photography projects. The assembly of the rig requires basic DIY skills, including the use of a drill, as well as a few nuts and bolts. For example, malaria samples require a higher level of fluorescent filters. Foldscope was designed by Prakash Lab, a research group in the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford University. All the components, including micro optics, are embedded into the sheet of paper. There are three stages - the optical stage, the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. Once folded, there is room to place a sample slide, before these built-in stages are used to illuminate and magnify objects up to 2,000x. It can accommodate standard glass slides, 3-inches (75mm) long, by 1 inch (25mm) wide, but Prakash said the kits come with plastic slides to improve safety. There are three stages in the paper - the optical stage, the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. Once folded, there is room to place a standard glass sample slide before these built-in stages are used to illuminate and magnify objects up to 2,000x . These are a selection of images captured by the Foldscope including (pictured left to right) Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, Giardia lamblia, Leishmania donovani and E. Coli and Bacillus. The Foldscope can accommodate standard glass slides, but also come with plastic slides . The paper the Foldscope is built into doesn’t feature instructions; instead it has a colour-coded key that helps anyone, speaking any language to build the Foldscope. During a TED demonstration, Prakash stood on the Foldscope and threw it around to prove how rugged it is, and because it is portable, a light can be shone through the lens to project images onto any surface. This diagram explains how Prakash Lab was able to make the Foldscope so affordable. Each of the parts, listed in the table in the top left-hand corner, costs less than $50 (30p). This image also reveals how the different components fit within the paper . A resolution test, made using the Foldscope, shows a micron in the left-hand image and two micron beads in the right image. Researchers claim the Foldscope can be stood on and because it is portable, a light can be shone through the lens to project images onto any surface . Since the goal is to strip out all the complexity, Prakash said each specific foldscope provides one kind of imaging capability: either bright-field, reflected light, dark-field, polarization, fluorescence and projection microscopy. Each microscope also has a fixed magnification and corresponding resolution optimised for the application. The researchers are recruiting 10,000 beta users to test the microscopes in a variety of settings before looking to manufacture it on a wider scale.',\n",

Intermediaries claiming to represent Brentford have approached the former Spain international sounding out his availability, while Warburton insists that he understands 'the club have to plan for any eventuality.' Jemez has plenty of interest and is intrigued by the Brentford project but is keen to take another post in Spain. Warburton, 52, a former defender at Leicester City, has caught the eye of other clubs also with his work at Brentford and it is understood the Griffin Park club is covering all bases by sounding out other options. A club statement read: 'The Club is aware of some press speculation about the future of our Manager, Mark Warburton. 'Given Mark’s increasing profile within the game, we recognise that he will deservedly have turned the heads of other clubs.' Warburton said: 'My only focus is on the team and the match tonight [Tuesday]. I'm disappointed that the focus is on all this rather than the game. We are in a good position with 17 games to go. 'The team have done well and I understand the club have to plan for any eventuality, it is a very forward-thinking club. But my only focus is a big game.' Full back Jake Bidwell challenges Jelle Vossen during Brentford's clash against Middlesbrough . The Brentford statement continued: 'As with every other sensibly run club, we plan for various possible eventualities. 'We are a progressive club who do talk to other people within the game to learn about other ways of doing things, and to consider novel strategic approaches to the game. 'Those conversations continue internally, and are part of a healthy dialogue. 'Football is sometimes called a village, and in any village, gossip and rumours can spread like wildfire, whether or not such rumours are true. 'It would not be in the Club’s interests to disclose any of those discussions, but Brentford FC do want to confirm that Mark Warburton remains our manager. 'The team’s performance has been magnificent this season and that is primarily down to Mark’s leadership. 'Mark will continue to lead the club in its push for Premier League football. 'At this critical stage of the season, we don’t propose to make any further statements in relation to these rumours.'\",\n",

Audiences clearly enjoyed what they saw too: \"District 9\" has already soared to No. 78 on IMDb\\'s top 250 movies list, although it\\'ll obviously drop some as the initial euphoria wears off. Second place went to \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,\" which dropped 59 percent in its second weekend but still managed to recruit $22.5 million. The $175 million action movie should pass $100 million domestically by Monday. \"The Time Traveler\\'s Wife\" materialized into third place with $19.2 million in its debut weekend, proving that there is a market for watching Eric Bana disappear. Rounding out the top 5 were \"Julie & Julia\" (No. 4 with $12.4 million) and \"G-Force\" (No. 5 with $6.9 million), respectively. Also opening wide was a trio of movies that failed to make a significant dent on the box office. \"The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,\" a cars-salesmen comedy starring Jeremy Piven, barely registered on the mercury thermometer by earning $5.4 million. \"Ponyo,\" the 10th film by Japan\\'s animation auteur Hayao Miyazaki, grossed $3.5 million on 927 screens. While that amount represents Miyazaki\\'s best opening weekend in America, it\\'s still fish feed compared to \"Ponyo\\'s\" worldwide gross of $187 million. The music comedy \"Bandslam\" won\\'t be getting any requests for encores after making only $2.3 million from more than 2,000 screens ? even the promise of seeing the \"Taylor Lautner takes off his shirt\" trailer of The \"Twilight\" Saga: New Moon couldn\\'t save the Vanessa Hudgens movie. In limited release, the Jimmy Page/The Edge/Jack White music documentary \"It Might Get Loud\" opened promisingly, grossing $101,000 from just seven theaters.

One of Bryan Ferry's sons avoided jail yesterday after being caught carrying\\xa0 a knife for a second time. Merlin Ferry, 22, had told police to go away and 'investigate real crime' when he was found with the weapon. Officers stopped the student in his uninsured Saab and were searching for drugs when they arrested him for carrying the knife. He told the officers: 'You can unarrest me now. Merlin Ferry, pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court, has been warned he will face jail if caught carrying a knife again . And he continued to show no remorse . yesterday, complaining about being forced to get up early to travel to . court from his Shropshire home. The Marlborough-educated student . received a community order after the judge delivered a stern lecture on . the\\xa0 dangers of knife crime. The sentence comes just two years . after a case was dropped when he was stopped while carrying a Gurkha . knife. His lawyer successfully argued that weapon – known as a Kukri\\xa0 – . was part of a fancy dress outfit he was wearing to a student party. Ferry, who is studying in Barcelona, . was subjected to a lengthy dressing down yesterday at Isleworth Crown . Court, in West London. Judge Paul Dugdale told him that . coming from a privileged background does not mean the 'normal rules' do . not apply to him, and warned him of the dangers of carrying a knife . 'You could walk down the corridor here . at Isleworth and go into a courtroom and hear a case where someone had . their face opened by a knife and were scarred for life. Ferry's brother Otis was one of the pro-hunt protesters, pictured in white T-shirts, who pushed into the House of Commons in 2004 during a fox hunt debate . 'That was caused by somebody who had a knife, problems arose, things happened and it ended up being used. 'You know of the number of deaths and . murders in London that are caused because people have knives in their . pockets and somebody is left dead: that is why there are a large number . of people calling for a minimum of one year's custody for somebody . caught with a knife.' The judge said many would have . expected that the 'penny would have dropped' after the first knife . incident. He added: 'Those that have the chance to make a success of . their lives without the normal hardship of life are very lucky. 'It has taken a bit of time for you to . realise that luck and good fortune does not take you out of the normal . world or that normal rules do not apply to you. Merlin Ferry, left, told police to 'un-arrest' him and to 'investigate real crime' when he was stopped. He is pictured with Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry, centre, and brothers (left to right) Isaac, Otis and Tara . Judge Paul Dugdale told Merlin Ferry that he was 'very lucky' to come from such a privileged background and as the son of Bryan Ferry, pictured, does not have the 'normal hardship of life' Judge Paul Dugdale sentenced Ferry at Isleworth Crown Court to a 12-months community order and 100 hours community service and ordered him to pay £500 costs . Otis Ferry was found guilty in October of failing to provide a breath sample . 'You are just another young man . carrying a knife and that makes you very frightening to people and that . is why people think I should send you to prison. 'If you carry a bladed article again . in public again you will spend six months of your life in Wormwood . Scrubs and the consequences on your lucky life so far will be . devastating. Don't think that will not happen, it will.' Ferry's probation officer said he had . shown 'no remorse' for the danger to the public he posed or the cost of . bringing him to justice. The official said he 'lacked insight into the . offence' and had said knife crime was something 'to do with London and . people on estates'. Ferry was stopped by police in his . silver Saab in Chelsea on September 29 last year. When asked if he had . anything in his pocket which could injure the officers as they searched . for drugs he said 'yes' and pulled out the lock-knife. He was arrested and told officers 'you . can just unarrest me now' before claiming the knife was a present from a . friend who had just returned from Greece. Ferry's mother is former model Lucy . Helmore, who divorced Roxy Music star Bryan Ferry in 2003. His . old-Etonian older brother Otis, 29, has been arrested several times over . his pro-hunting activism, including protesting inside the House of . Commons. He also has a conviction for drink-driving. Ferry, who admitted possessing a . bladed article, was placed on a 12-month community order, which includes . 100 hours' community service.

       " {'article': 'Gaza City (CNN) -- Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal arrived in Gaza Friday to a hero\\'s welcome, two weeks after a bloody fight with Israel that left the group energized and emboldened. He dropped down and kissed the ground after crossing into Gaza from Egypt at the Rafah border crossing. \"We politicians, we owe the people of Gaza, and the entire factions of the resistance, we owe the heroes and martyrs,\" Meshaal said. \"if it wasn\\'t for you we would have not visited Gaza.\" A jubilant crowd lined the road leading from the border crossing into Gaza City. Among the throng were hundreds of jubilant Hamas fighters, wearing fatigues and balaclavas, hoisting AK-47s and RPG launchers, and cheering Meshaal\\'s first visit to the Palestinian territory. Opinion: With cease-fire, Hamas\\' isolation has ended . The first appointments on his schedule included visits to the homes of former Hamas leaders and Gaza residents killed in recent years by Israeli\\'s strikes. Among the stops were the home of the Hamas military leader whose targeted killing by Israel in November opened the recent eight-day conflict, as well as the home where 10 members of one family died in an Israeli airstrike. Saturday, he will participate in a rally celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of Hamas. Meshaal, who has led Hamas from exile since 2004, is making his first visit to Gaza and his first to the Palestinian territories in 45 years. He left the Palestinian West Bank in 1967 at the age of 11 after Israel moved into the territory during the Six-Day War. Israel, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attempted to assassinate him in 1997. \"I say this my third birth,\" Meshaal told supporters, saying the first was his natural birth in 1956, while the second followed the attempted assassination. \"And this moment today, December 7, 2012, this I consider it to be my third birth, Meshaal said. \"And I ask God for our fourth birth with the entire liberation of Palestine.\" Read more: What is Hamas? The goal of Hamas is an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian state. Its manifesto advocates the destruction of the state of Israel, and calls for the raising of \"the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine.\" Hamas members, like most Palestinian factions and political parties, insist that Israel is an occupying power, and that the group is simply trying to liberate the Palestinian territories. Israel, the United States and other Western countries label Hamas a terrorist organization. The United States has also listed Meshaal as a terrorist since 2003. Hamas leader tells Amanpour his group wasn\\'t behind bombing . Meshaal has previously said the group would support a Palestinian state based on the borders that existed prior to the 1967 Six-Day War, during which Israeli troops occupied Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. The state would have East Jerusalem as its capital, he said. However, he has stopped short of backing a full two-state solution, including acceptance of Israel\\'s right to exist. He has long advocated a role for the threat of violence in forcing peace with Israel. \"You are successful in negotiation and in imposing your conditions on the enemy depending on the number of power cards you have on the ground,\" the Congressional Research Service quoted Meshaal as saying, citing a Jordanian newspaper. That perspective will be in full view in Saturday\\'s rally. Meshaal will speak to the assembled throng from a platform beneath a replica of the Qassam rockets fired at Israel during the recent conflict, in which 160 Palestinians and six Israelis died.

A Moscow oligarch whose attempted killers were allegedly fingered by the banker shot in London has claimed Russian 'terrorism' has arrived on Britain's streets. Alexander Antonov spoke out in support of German Gorbuntsov, 45, now in a coma after being gunned down in a suspected contract killing attempt last Tuesday. Shortly before the attack the wounded banker had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia-style assassination bid against Mr Antonov, a key figure in the Converse Bank empire. Coma: German Gorbuntsov (left) was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near Canary Wharf in an attempted assassination. There are now also fears for the safety of Larisa Gorbuntsov (right) who flew to her husband's bedside in London . At one point, the Russian authorities . regarded Mr Gorbuntsov as a possible suspect because of an alleged . $106million debt owed by Mr Antonov to Gorbuntsov. Yesterday, 61-year-old Mr Antonov claimed that he and Mr Gorbuntsov had 'normal' and even 'friendly' relations. 'He was not a part of the . assassination attempt. He had some information about how it was . prepared, and wanted to pass it on, that's it,' he said. Asked why Mr Gorbuntsov had been . targeted, he said: 'Perhaps because the people who did it were very . scared of this information getting publicly known, specially given that, . as I understood, German was adamant in his decision to make it public. 'So they went as far in the centre of . the legal world - I consider London to be the capital of the legal world . - in prime time, to carry out this slaughter.' He stressed: 'My personal attitude to . it is that it simply beggars belief, it beggars belief. How can you sort . business issues by such methods? It is terrorism. It is simply . terrorism. Shooting: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was attacked on the Isle of Dogs close to Canary Wharf . 'But I think the fact that it happened . in London does give hope to believe that Russian and British law . enforcement systems would together discover who did it, and get the . b******s.' Asked if he agreed that the two men . named by Mr Gorbuntsov to Russian prosecutors - Pyotr Chuvilin and Sergei . Mendeleyev - as being behind the Mr Antonov assassination attempt, were . indeed involved. 'I'm scared to give the positive . answer to that, is it up to the investigation and the court to establish . it. But they can be somewhere there. Nearby. ' Asked if Russians were behind the crime, he said: 'I agree.' Asked whether he would now feel safe coming to London, he said: 'Well, what do you do? You've got to keep living. ' Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf . Gorbuntsov's testimony appeared to give the missing link in establishing who ordered the attack against Antonov. Gorbuntsov's lawyer Vadim Vedenin has . admitted in the Mr Antonov case that his client was initially 'suspected in . organising this attempt on his life', because he was present at the . meeting where property claims to the Antonov family were talked about . and where the Antonovs were threatened. 'This is true, he was present there, . we do not deny it. But still he is not in anyway related to the attempt . on his life itself.' Alexander Antonov, father of former Portsmouth FC owner Vladimir Antonov, lost the use of an arm after a 2009 assassination bid in Moscow. Three Chechen men were convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison on long sentences a year later, but police never identified the mastermind. The same gang was convicted of killing Ruslan Yamadayev, rivals to hardman Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Kremlin-backed president. Ex-Russian MP Yamadayev was gunned down in his car close to the British Embassy in Moscow in September 2008. His brother Sulim, a Kadyrov enemy, was shot dead in Dubai in March 2009 by men using a gold-plated pistol. In November 2006 Russian dissident Alexander . Litvinenko (pictured above) was murdered in London. British . prosecutors have named his fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the . main suspect in his poisoning with radioactive polonium-210. However, the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK.' The lawyer stressed: 'He clearly said he had nothing to do with the attempt on Antonov's life.' It has also emerged Mr Gorbuntsov was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain for himself and his family. The financier's business visa, which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008, expires next year. It is thought the 45-year-old feared he would be forced to return to Russia and into the clutches of his many enemies. He said recently: ‘If I go back to . Russia, they will kill me.’ Last night Mr Gorbuntsov was under armed . guard in hospital after being hit up to six times. With . the would-be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the . safety of Mr Gorbuntsov’s wife Larisa, 46, and son. Mrs Gorbuntsov flew . to London to be at her husband’s bedside while their 25-year-old son . Vladislav is seeking a visa to come to Britain. Scotland . Yard yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the . shooting to come forward. Mr Gorbuntsov was shot after being dropped off . by taxi at his apartment block next to Canary Wharf on Tuesday evening. The . banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City . earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just . stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The . hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot. A . young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the . mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services . arrived. Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer also said the banker had been planning to submit a . political asylum request to stay within days. A successful asylum claim . would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on . allegations of embezzlement. There . was also an apparent financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways, . whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin. An estimated £415million . was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank . whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.\",\n",

Neiman Marcus customers look to be the latest victims of hackers targeting credit card information from big retail chains. The Dallas-based retailer confirmed on Friday it had a cyber security breach in mid-December and an undisclosed number of customers' cards were compromised. It is not yet known how many people have been affected, according to ABC Local. The company says it is taking the necessary steps to notify customers with cards that have definitely been used frequently. Compromised: Upmarket department store Neiman Marcus has been forced to admit they have had a credit card data breach after the story was unearthed on Friday . Much like Target, who have confirmed some 70 million customers of their customers were affected by a hacking scandal in December, Neimen Marcus say it is only in-store shoppers, not online shoppers, that have been vulnerable to the data breach . Neiman Marcus issued the following statement over the issue. 'We informed federal law enforcement agencies and are working actively with the U.S. Secret Service, the payment brands, our credit card processor, a leading investigations, intelligence and risk management firm, and a leading forensics firm to investigate the situation,' the statement said. The hack was unearthed by independent security researcher Brian Krebs reported on Friday. The news comes on the same day that Target announced its December security breach may have affected as many as 70 million customers - not the 40 million it initially had estimated. Interestingly, the Neiman Marcus data breach happened at the same time as the Target scandal - mid-December. Upscale retailer Neiman Marcus isn't yet saying how many customers might be at risk, but it is confirming that a breach of credit card data took place. Also like Target, online shoppers don't seem to be affected, just in-store customers. Neiman Marcus says it's started to contain the intrusion and is taking 'significant' steps to enhance its information security. 'The security of our customers' information is always a priority and we sincerely regret any inconvenience,' the statement said. 'We are taking steps, where possible, to notify customers whose cards we know were used fraudulently after making a purchase at our store.' 'Earlier this week, I began hearing from sources in the financial industry about an increasing number of fraudulent credit and debit card charges that were being traced to cards that had been very recently used at brick-and-mortar stores run by the Dallas, Texas based high-end retail chain,' Krebs wrote.\",\n",

Twenty-four hours after Luis Suarez hit the headlines for biting Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay’s 1-0 win over Italy, another Liverpool player was drawing attention to themselves for the wrong reasons. Mamadou Sakho, who has started each of France’s three games at the World Cup so far, should have been dismissed in the eighth minute for elbowing Ecuador’s Oswaldo Minda in the face while jostling for a corner. The centre-back could face retrospective action from Fifa for his stray elbow, with the referee not spotting the incident during the game. Not spotted: Mamadou Sakho elbows Oswaldo Minda in the eighth minute but it went unpunished . Strapped: Sakho's leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark but he was lucky to not leave earlier . Sakho’s heavily-strapped left leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark, with Real Madrid’s Raphael Varane the player that replaced him at the back for Les Bleus. It was a disjointed performance from Didier Deschamps’ side, which was somewhat expected when you consider the 1998 World Cup winner made seven changes to the side that sealed a place in the last 16 by trouncing Switzerland 5-2 in their previous group match. Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, a late replacement in the squad for injured Clement Grenier, was living in dreamland as he joined Blaise Matuidi and Paul Pogba in central midfield. From planning his holidays to making his international debut in a World Cup game at the Maracana - all in the space of a month. He looked comfortable on the ball, especially in the second half when France enjoyed a numerical advantage following Antonio Valencia’s dismissal for an over-the-top challenge on Lucas Digne. Elsewhere Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna provided some brilliant deliveries from the right-hand side, particularly when Premier League target Antoinne Griezmann forced Alexander Rodriguez into a smart stop at his near post and when Pogba nodded wide late on. Dreamland: France and Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) joined the action . Block: Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna provided brilliant deliveries from the right-hand side . His old Arsenal team-mate Laurent Koscielny started in place of Varane, but was shaky on the rare occasions that the impressive Enner Valencia was able to run at goal for Ecuador. France went into the game having not lost in their last six World Cup games against South American opposition, and that record was not put under threat in Rio as Ecuador struggled to create many chances of note. Their place in the knockout rounds was sealed with a win against Switzerland last time out, but that does not excuse what was an impotent performance at the Maracana. A particularly wild effort from Pogba, under no pressure 40 yards from goal, epitomised their bluntness going forward. Unlucky: Karim Benzema couldn't add to his World Cup tally after two impressive opening games . Karim Benzema, so clinical in the opening two games, failed to add to his tally of three tournament goals, as Rodriguez made a string of impressive saves in the second half. The Real Madrid man was perhaps fortunate not to be replaced, particularly as Deschamps clearly had one eye on their last 16 clash with Nigeria. Despite going a man down on the hour-mark Ecuador occasionally looked dangerous on the break. Fortunately for France, Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was on hand to spare their blushes in the final minutes, making a decent save from Juan Carlos Paredes’ curling shot. France’s match was bookended by incidents involving Premier League elbows, as Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud clashed with an Ecuador defender late on.

Although Neal said Prejean \"breached her contract\" by keeping the semi-nude photo or photos a secret, the only pictures published so far appear about as revealing as the bikini Prejean wore in the pageant\\'s swimsuit competition. \"We have been told by Carrie Prejean there are no other photos other than the one circulating in existence. She should know better than anyone,\" Miss California USA Director Keith Lewis said Wednesday before the latest photo was released.  Watch reaction to racy photos » . Pageant officials were not immediately available for comment on the new picture. The 21-year-old Miss USA contestant has been the center of controversy since she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question on the national pageant stage last month. She finished as runner-up to Miss USA. In a statement given to CNN on Tuesday, Prejean said the photos -- and she did use the plural -- were being used in a \"vicious and mean-spirited\" effort to silence her for \"defending traditional marriage.\" While she vowed to \"continue to support and defend marriage as the honorable institution it is,\" Prejean may be doing so without the Miss California USA title. State pageant officials met Tuesday with lawyers and representatives of Donald Trump, who owns the international competition, to consider whether they had grounds to take the crown away from Prejean, according to Neal. \"When you compete for Miss California, you\\'re supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos, because it\\'s grounds for disqualification,\" he said. CNN obtained a copy of the pageant contract Prejean signed last year, in which she agreed that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification. The first photo made public shows Prejean -- who said she was 17 at the time -- wearing pink panties and no top. She is turned away from the camera, with her arm hiding most of her breast. The second photo is essentially the same, but Prejean is looking over her opposite shoulder. It was unclear whether pageant officials would consider that a semi-nude photo, in light of their standard requirement that contestants parade across stage wearing a bikini that arguably shows more skin. Ahead of the second photo being published, Nik Richie -- of TheDirty.com -- said he was upgrading his Web site\\'s servers to handle the flood of traffic he expects will come after he posts the additional photos. \"I will slowly roll these out,\" Richie said. The Web site appeared to be overwhelmed by traffic early Thursday. CNN tried to access it, but could not. \"We\\'ll see what happens with those and we want to know who\\'s releasing them,\" Neal said. Shanna Moakler, the co-executive director of the Miss California USA organization, will meet with Tami Farrell, the runner-up for the title, \"to discuss the possible next steps,\" Neal said. Prejean defended the photos, which she said were taken when she was a teenager aspiring to be a Victoria\\'s Secret model. \"I am a Christian, and I am a model,\" she said. \"Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos.\" She said the photos \"have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith.\" \"I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be,\" she said. \"But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive. While we may not agree on every issue, we should show respect for others\\' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean-spirited attacks.\" Her publicist, Melany Ethridge, confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity Web site TMZ in which she said Prejean was 17 when she posed for the photos, hoping they would land her a modeling job. \"In her naivete, an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company, claiming they could make her the next Victoria\\'s Secret model,\" Ethridge told TMZ. \"She has since learned what a lie that was, and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken.\" Prejean announced last week that she would star in a new $1.5 million ad campaign supporting \"opposite marriage\" (marriage between a man and a woman) funded by the National Organization for Marriage. \"Marriage is good,\" Prejean said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign. \"There is something special about unions of husband and wife. Unless we bring men and women together, children will not have mothers and fathers.\" CNN\\'s Aileen Martinez contributed to this report.',\n",

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- The Philadelphia Eagles welcomed Michael Vick back into the National Football League on Friday after the quarterback spent almost two years in federal prison on a felony dogfighting conviction. Michael Vick speaks at a Philadelphia Eagles news  conference on Friday. Vick, formerly with the Atlanta Falcons, has signed a two-year deal with the Eagles. \"I think everybody deserves a second chance,\" Vick said at a news conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Friday. \"Now I want to be part of the solution and not the problem.\" The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. Vick, 29, was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20 and returned to his Virginia home to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. iReport.com: Is this a good move? \"Everything that happened at that point in my life was wrong,\" Vick said of his involvement with the dogfighting ring.  Watch bloggers discuss Vick\\'s return to the NFL » . \"I had to reach a turning point. Prison definitely did it for me,\" he said. Flanked by Eagles coach Andy Reid and former NFL coach Tony Dungy, who acted as a mentor to Vick after he was imprisoned, the newest Eagle vowed \"to do all the right things.\" \"I want to be an ambassador to the NFL and the community,\" he said. \"I\\'m glad I got ... a second chance. I won\\'t disappoint.\" Dungy said that he thinks Vick can revive his career and turn his life around in Philadelphia but that the quarterback will be tested by fickle Eagles fans. \"He is gonna have a lot of people who do not think he should be playing. He\\'s got to prove them wrong on the field and off the field,\" Dungy said.  Watch why Dungy thinks Vick will be a positive force » . Earlier reaction to Vick\\'s signing was mixed. The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday night in a statement that it was \"incredibly disappointed\" at the news. \"Philadelphia is a city of dog lovers and, most particularly, pit bull lovers,\" said Susan Cosby, the organization\\'s chief executive officer. \"To root for someone who participated in the hanging, drowning, electrocution and shooting of dogs will be impossible for many, no matter how much we would all like to see the Eagles go all the way.\" However, Ed Sayres, president and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said in a statement that \"[NFL] Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Philadelphia Eagles have granted Michael Vick a second chance, and the ASPCA expects Mr. Vick to express remorse for his actions, as well as display more compassion and sound judgment this time around than he did during his previous tenure with the NFL. \"We hope that Mr. Vick uses his stature for the betterment of the community and the advancement of the issue of animal cruelty,\" Sayres said. Reid said he knows that there are some fans who will not accept Vick. \"I understand how that works,\" he said. \"But there\\'s enough of them that will, and then it\\'s up to Michael to prove that that change has taken place. I think he\\'s there. That\\'s what he wants to do.\" He said Vick \"seems very focused, and he wants to get his career back on track.\" It is unclear what role Vick will play in the Eagles\\' offense. But it was clear that the move had the blessing of Eagles starting quarterback Donovan McNabb. \"I pretty much lobbied to get him here,\" McNabb said. \"Because everybody deserves a second chance.\" The NFL reinstated Vick on a conditional basis last month. Vick \"will be considered for full reinstatement and to play in regular-season games by Week 6 based on the progress he makes in his transition plan,\" the league said in a statement last month. Week 6 of the NFL season is in October. Vick may participate in practices, workouts and meetings and may play in his club\\'s final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement, the league said last month. \"I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege, not a right, and I am truly thankful for [the] opportunity I have been given,\" Vick said in a statement last month upon his reinstatement. Goodell said last month that Vick underwent tests, including a psychiatric evaluation, after requests from animal rights groups. Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At a hearing in that case, he told the judge he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison. Court documents released in Vick\\'s case showed that two of his co-defendants, who also pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal, said that Vick helped kill dogs that didn\\'t fight well and that all three men \"executed approximately eight dogs\" in ways that included hanging and drowning. The dogs were killed because they fared poorly in \"testing\" sessions held at Vick\\'s property. The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns. Wayne Pacelle, the organization\\'s president, has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist youths who have been involved. In November, Vick pleaded guilty to a state dogfighting charge and received a three-year suspended sentence. The Eagles are scheduled to play Vick\\'s former team, the Falcons, in Atlanta on December 6.',\n",

       " {'article': \"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . Four-year-old Lyla has become the youngest person ever to sample the $295 nine-course tasting menu at world-renowned restaurant The French Laundry - and her verdict is in. Lyla spent over five hours at chef Thomas Keller's triple Michelin star eatery, located in California's Nappy Valley; where she was served everything from caviar and butter-poached lobster to 'hen egg custard' and truffled gnocchi, as Bold Italic took notes on her opinions. The summer melon soup was held in particular high regard for tasting like 'Tinker Bell Popsicles', but the edible flowers were puzzling for Lyla, and upon assessing the Jardinière de légumes, she piped up: 'At least it’s a salad, but it’s not very much salad.' Where's the rest of it? Four-year-old Lyla reviewed the nine-course tasting menu at The French Laundry, a California restaurant with three Michelin stars, widely hailed as being 'the best restaurant in the world' The French Laundry has been hailed by celebrity chef and food critic Anthony Bourdain as 'the best restaurant in the world, period' - and crucially for Lyla, has 'the most elegant bathroom I've ever SEEN.' Established in 1978, it serves two different nine-course tasting menus daily; none of which uses the same ingredient twice. The fixed price is $295 before tipping, and wine pairing costs an extra $250; although in this case it was ginger ale served in a champagne glass, which Lyla was 'obsessed' with. 'Is this a flower? To eat? Eww. I'm keeping this. I'm gonna give it some water' Lyla's first dish - an amuse-bouche consisting of 'avocado and lime crème fraîche wrapped in a sesame-seed tuile' - looked deceptively like an ice cream cone; which happens to be Lyla's favorite food (as long as it's a 'HARD cone'). 'I like the white part better than the green part,' she surmised, after she had recovered from the crippling disappointment of the ice cream no-show. Mixed feelings: The soup was held in high regard for tasting like 'Tinker Bell Popsicles', but Lyla was disappointed when an amuse-bouche which looked like an ice cream turned out to be an avocado wrap . After the summer melon soup - which was green, thus perhaps the Tinkerbell reference - Lyla was served two fishy dishes; the restaurant's notoriously decadent 'oysters and pearls' caviar plate, and the 'citrus-cured pacific yellowtail.' Lyla obstinately refused to try either of them, because they looked to be 'really not good.' 'It looks like the house that bees live in. And I HATE bees!' Next up was the 'hen egg custard,' which was served in an egg shell with its top sawn-off and filled with a 'ragoût of périgord truffles.' Lyla was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of the egg, theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it. Once she'd forgiven the chef his blatant lie, she loved this course, and concluded that the chicken was like a 'fluffy marshmallow' and the feather tasted like a 'potato chip.' It should be noted that neither chicken nor feather were present in this meal. Swanky: Established in 1978, French Laundry serves two different nine-course tasting menus daily; none of which uses the same ingredient twice . What are you misleading me? Lyla was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of this egg, theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it . The following meaty charcuterie board was eschewed in favor of the accompanying bread, which she gobbled up with great relish before demanding seconds. As for the pretentiously small salad, Lyla insisted that the peppers 'taste like babies', and that the edible flower was downright bonkers. 'Is this a flower? To eat? Eww. I'm keeping this. 'I'm gonna give it some water,' she said with some concern, before instead chopping it up into pieces on the tablecloth. Excellent taste: Lyla was 'obsessed' with the ginger ale (pictured) and she also loved the shaved truffles, which she referred to fondly as 'black diamonds.' Her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be better if they were pink . Thrillingly, the next course consisted of more bread; this time served with 'molded butter.' Lyla was outraged. 'It looks like the house that bees live in. And I HATE bees!' she exclaimed. There was another argument regarding the following dish, the 'sweet butter-poached maine lobster with black mission fig jam', which Lyla maintained was in fact shrimp. The shaved truffles on the 'russet potato gnocchi' were a delight for the four-year-old critic with surprisingly sophisticated taste, likened fondly to 'black diamonds.' Her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be even better if they were pink. Impressive notes of chocolate: The rich assortment of desserts went down a treat with Lyla, providing a sugary ending to a roller-coaster of culinary first's for the adorable tot . Spoiled for life: When Lyla's mother suggested they head out for a good old-fashioned pizza next time, she demanded they go back to The French Laundry instead . The 'herb roasted elysian fields farm lamb' was branded 'not delicious' and the subsequent 'cabot clothbound cheddar', though it claimed to be served with 'garden broccoli', was accused by Lyla of being yet another dishonesty. 'I don't see any broccoli. It's just a square with other stuff!' she proclaimed. 'I don't see any broccoli. It's just a square with other stuff!' The rich assortment of desserts went down a treat with Lyla; providing a sugary ending to a roller-coaster of culinary first's for the adorable tot. Her mother, however, may now have a bit of a problem on her hands. When she suggested to Lyla that they head out for a good old-fashioned pizza next time, she was met with an outcry. Lyla demanded that they instead return to The French Laundry, her new favorite joint; along with the rest of the world it seems.\",\n",

A TV news anchor in Colorado is so fed up with people taking photos of their snow-covered patio furniture to show how much snow has accumulated whenever there's a storm that he devoted two whole minutes of airtime to explain to viewers that they can do better. 'C'mon, Colorado. We can do better than this. We love winter. We own winter. Let's take the pictures to prove it,' 9NEWS anchor Kyle Clark said in his humorous rant. Clark - who is originally from Upstate New York - feels that, given Colorado's natural beauty, residents should start taking photos of things slightly more impressive than the patio furniture they bought at Costco. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fed up: Colorado anchor Kyle Clark thinks the state's residents can do better when it comes to photographically documenting snow storms . Enough: 'Yes, everyone is impressed you have a four-piece set - we saw it at Costco, too' 'We live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth but we point our cameras towards the back porch...yes, everyone is impressed you have a four-piece set - we saw it at Costco, too. Chair covers? Somebody got a raise. A grill? Nice. Three grills? Easy there, Bobby Flay,' he jokes. Clark explains that there are simple things people can do to make their winter patio shots a little more interesting. According to Clark, 'if you like it then you should have put a thing on it.' Clark suggests including a 'disgruntled dog' in your winter, patio shots. Or 'your husband drinking a beer' - anything to liven up the monotony of patio shots that are constantly coming into his newsroom. Not impressed: 'A grill? Nice. Three grills? Easy there, Bobby Flay,' Boring: With all the natural beauty in Colorado, Clark wants people to photograph things other than chairs covered in snow . People take shots of their patios, Clark explains, because it's easy - you just 'point the camera out the window and click.' But - as Clark points out - Colorado residents don't 'take the easy way out.' 'We blasted a road through the Rockies. We put a cliff in a Mexican restaurant,' Clark says. 'Our welcome sign is a demon horse with crazy laser eyes. We don't do easy around here.' Clark ended his rant by dropping his lapel mic, as if to say 'peace, I'm outta here.' Clark later took to Twitter to share some reactions to his editorial - and not everyone found it as amusing as he did.

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- It\\'s a club that has built its reputation on developing some of the world\\'s best players, but leading European club Barcelona has been hit by a transfer ban imposed by FIFA after breaking the world governing body\\'s rules relating to the \"international transfer of minors.\" Barca\\'s youth players are drawn not just from Catalonia and Spain, but also from around the globe and trying to recruit the world\\'s best is a competitive business -- Argentine Lionel Messi joined Barca at the age of 11. If you get the development of young players right it can be a hugely lucrative business. In June Barcelona said of the 25 players in its first team, 17 came its youth academy -- the highest percentage of recent years. Unless it manages to successfully appeal the FIFA ban, Barca will be prevented from signing players -- both youth and senior players -- in the next two transfer windows. That could have severe consequences for the Spanish champions. Transfer windows are important for all clubs as they allow them to refresh their squads. That\\'s important not just for maintaining on-field competitiveness but also for marketing purposes, such as selling shirts. Last summer, for example, Barca invested nearly $120 million on just one player -- Brazilian international Neymar. Later Wednesday on its website, Barcelona said it would appeal the ruling, citing 14 reasons, and take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if necessary. \"FCB will also demand the relevant interim measures needed to preserve the Club\\'s rights, amongst which are those allowing it to sign players in transfer windows,\" it said in a statement. The FIFA ruling comes after an investigation found the Spanish champions had broken regulations regarding the transfer of young players from outside Spain. FIFA\\'s investigation focused on several players aged under 18 who were registered and played for the club between 2009 and 2013. Under FIFA laws, clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the European Union, is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border. \"The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000 ($508,000),\" read a FIFA statement. \"Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularize the situation of all minor players concerned. \"The investigations concerned several minor players who were registered and participated in competitions with the club over various periods between 2009 and 2013.\" The Spanish Football Federation has also been hit with a CHF 500,000 ($565,000) fine by FIFA. The Spanish Federation was not immediately available for comment. The ban on Barcelona means the club will be unable to buy players during the \"summer\" transfer window which runs between June and August, and the January 2015 window. \"In this respect, the Disciplinary Committee emphasized that the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is an important social and legal issue that concerns all stakeholders in football,\" continued the statement. \"The Disciplinary Committee underlined that FIFA takes the protection of minors in football very seriously.\" It is unclear whether the ban will affect transfers Barca have in the pipeline. German goalkeeper Andre Ter Stegen has reportedly been linked with a move to Barca from Borussia Monchengladbach this summer, while highly-rated 17-year-old Alen Halilovic is set to arrive at the Camp Nou from Dinamo Zagreb. This is not the first negative story that has threatened to derail Barca\\'s season. President Sandro Rosell resigned in January after a judge ordered a hearing to investigate the misappropriation of funds during the signing of Brazil star Neymar in 2013. Neymar was on the scoresheet as Barca drew 1-1 with Atletico Madrid in Tuesday\\'s European Champions League quarterfinal first leg. Pictures: 34 amazing sport photos .',\n",

Too many actors are mumbling their way through lines leaving audiences struggling to understand them as they attempt to 'copy American film stars', according to some of the great and good of theatre. Doing away with the clear and enunciated acting style of yesteryear, some  directors and producers actively encourage 'laidback mumbling', as it is more 'truthful', it has been said. But it has infuriated well established and leading theatre figures, including Edward Kemp, the artistic director of Rada and renowned classical actress Imogen Stubbs. Imogen Stubbs as Lady Torrance in 'Orpheus Descending'. But the established theatre actress says too many actors are mumbling their way through lines leaving audiences struggling to understand them . Mr Kemp is concerned that the new style of delivery could mean audiences are driven away from stage productions of the works of Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde, among others, because they are unable to understand them, the Observer reports. Ms Stubbs is concerned that the muttering is an attempt to imitate American film stars. She leveled particular criticism at Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, saying: 'You're just longing for it to stop and breathe...They were rather garbling their lines.' Mr Kemp said the problem was with 'education'. Ms Stubbs leveled particular criticism at Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, saying: 'You're just longing for it to stop and breathe...They were rather garbling their lines' He said Rada had had to change its training programme to adapt to teenagers who did not have the 'faintest notion of basic grammar'. He said he had even encountered a first year student who had achieved an English A-level who had no idea what a noun was, and revealed Rada had to do away with a sight-reading test of a Dickens passage from auditions because it was too painful to listen to. He said older and established actors honed their deliver through the use of pitch, intonation and tempo -\\xa0 whereas today's actors relied on volume. While Ms Stubbs said that others are terrified of being caught sounding 'like an old-fashioned actor'. Rada is rethinking its voice training as it gets ready to launch its first public festival, which will be held from 29 June until 6 July .\",\n",

       " {'article': \"A schoolgirl who spotted grammatical 'mistakes' in her English exam has written a letter of complaint - to Education Secretary Michael Gove. Eagle-eyed Rebecca Lee, 10, a pupil at Christ Church Primary School in Clifton, Bristol,  noticed commas 'missing' from two questions in her SATs last Tuesday. The Year Six pupil says she was so 'annoyed' by the basic punctuation errors that she wanted to take her complaint to the top. Rebecca Lee, 10, from Bristol, wrote to Education Secretary Michael Gove over punctuation errors in her SATs . So she wrote to Mr Gove saying: 'I understand that you are very keen for us to all learn our complex sentences and use of accurate punctuation. 'I believe that your department should also use the correct punctuation in all SATs tasks.' The schoolgirl said she hoped to hear back from Mr Gove. Rebecca, from Clifton, said: 'The exam wording should be setting an example and I was annoyed. I had to write. 'I've not heard back yet and am still waiting - Mr Gove's busy but I do hope to get a response back.' The 'mistakes' were in a section of the exam on complex sentences - and had commas 'missing' from two sentences. Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, and the letter he was sent by Bristol schoolgirl Rebecca Lee, right . One sentence read: 'If there is not enough rainfall this month there will be a drought' and 'As he was the chief of the tribe the final decision was his.' This afternoon a spokesman for the Department for Education defended the lack of commas in the exam paper. He said: 'The commas here are a matter of choice. They can be used to mark out clauses that appear at the beginning or the end of a sentence, but they are not necessary. 'We decided to use commas sometimes and not at others to make the tests more like real life where people will have their own styles. 'The only clauses that must be surrounded by commas are those in the middle of a sentence.' The same sentences - featuring commas in the correct places - had appeared in an earlier part of the exam on grammar. Around half a million pupils around the country took the same exam last week. Bright spark: Rebecca Lee discussed the errors in her exam with schoolfriends before writing to Mr Gove . Rebecca's mother Jo Lee, 40, a town . planner, said: 'A group of children were discussing in the playground . that there had been a mistake and that it wasn't right. 'Rebecca . said she thought she should write to whoever was responsible and found . that it was Michael Gove. I helped her write the letter and we emailed . it. 'It's great that she . decided to do it. Generally, I encourage her to do these types of things . - to stand up to the people who are supposed to be setting an example. I'm fully behind her.' The Government's Standards and Testing Agency is meant to check if exams are up to scratch before pupils take them, but a spokesman insisted that using commas in complex sentences was 'a matter of choice'. Rebecca's teacher Barney Braithwaite said many of his pupils noticed the mistake when they undertook the new spelling, punctuation and grammar test. He said: 'I laughed my head off when I had heard that Rebecca had sent the letter. She obviously felt moved enough by the mistakes.' Susie Dent has advised Countdown contestants (and hosts) on linguistic matters since 1992 . Susie Dent, the resident word expert on Countdown, says that while adding a comma into the two sentences Rebecca Lee complained about would help them flow better, it is not essential in either one. Mrs Dent, 45, who has sat in the Channel 4 show's Dictionary Corner adjudicating on linguistic matters since 1992, told MailOnline the comma 'serves as a signpost, helping us to understand what lies ahead and, in many cases, removing ambiguity'. She added: 'Each of these two sentences has a subordinate clause (a combination of words that do not form a complete sentence and which require another to complete the thought: 'If there is not enough rainfall this month', and 'As he was the chief of the tribe' both need more information before the sentence is complete). 'Adding a comma after each clause in these cases would make the sentences and their style flow smoothly, slowing them down almost to the rhythm of natural speech. 'However, in these particular instances, the comma is not essential and is more a matter of style than necessity; the reader will understand what is being said without them. 'A comma in the wrong place, however, can change the meaning entirely: 'If there is not enough rainfall, this month there will be a drought). Oxford-educated Mrs Dent is the longest-serving member of Countdown's on-screen team, and has appeared with presenters including the much-loved Richard Whiteley, Des Lynam, Des O'Connor, Jeff Stelling and current host, Nick Hewer. Mrs Dent, who studied modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford, before studying German at Princeton, worked as a language teacher and in publishing before going to work for the Oxford University Press. She has written several reports on language for the Oxford University Press, and lives in Oxford with her husband and two daughters.\",\n",

Around 3:30am last Thursday, an owl was hunting along\\xa0Highway 169 in Plymouth when it swooped down to catch its prey. Stuck: Kenneth Love was surprised when a swooping owl struck his car in the early morning and became lodged in the grille . At that exact moment, Kenneth Love was passing through the area and their fates collided, as the bird was struck at the perfect angle and became lodged in the grille of Love's car. After seeing the bird crash into the front of his car, he drove to a friend's house to try and pull the owl free with the help of some thick gloves. Watching: Love said the bird watched 'every move' he made as he and a friend tried unsuccessfully to pull the bird free . He records video of the rescue attempt, but in spite of all their efforts, the owl still can't get break free. Love tweeted that the owl 'kept looking at me every move I made while stuck' and told ABC the bird bit at him. Finally, Love calls police, who covered the bird's head with a towel before finally pulling it free. Love's own feathers were ruffled by the incident. He tweeted later: 'I don't care if I am a man. I'm just a city boy. Don't see this everyday.' The bird was then taken to the Minnesota Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota in St Paul, where it's currently recovering. According to the center's weekly patient census, the owl joined seven other great horned owls, one screech owl and one long-eared owl. This owl was lucky to be freed as quickly as it was. Last year, the Huffington Post reported a woman in south Florida struck an owl while driving along the turnpike late at night. She assumed she had killed the bird, saying that she didn't stop to check at the time because it was dark. When she went out to run errands the next day, a family flagged her down, telling her something was caught behind her grille. As it turns out, the owl had simply fallen through the slats and become stuck, though it emerged from the incident unscathed.\",\n",

       " {'article': 'Beijing, China (CNN) -- The Chinese public, especially those in the social networking community, are abuzz over the case of a man charged with killing a girl in a hit-and-run: He is the son of a local deputy police chief. Li Qiming, 23, is accused of \"perpetration of traffic accident,\" a charge punishable by three to seven years in prison. During the two-and-a-half hour trial Wednesday in the northern city of Baoding, Li admitted causing the death of Chen Xiaofeng, 20, according to Chinese media reports. It\\'s more than just a tragic traffic accident. \"There is a lot of popular anger about \\'guan er dai,\\' the children of officials who sometimes literally get away with murder,\" says Jeremy Goldkorn, founding editor-in-chief of Danwei, a China media website. He said the online uproar is focused on \"how likely it is that Li Qiming will get away with a light sentence, and whether blood money will secure his freedom.\" Official media have reported that Li was drunk when he ran over two female students on the Hebei University campus, killing Chen and injuring fellow student Zhang Jingjing. Li allegedly tried to speed away from the scene. It was also reported that, when students and campus security guards stopped him, he shouted at the guards, \"My daddy is Li Gang\" -- referring to a local deputy police chief. When indignant Chinese Internet users got wind of the story, they blogged and reposted it widely. Before long, \"My-daddy-is-Li-Gang\" went viral. \"It spread on the Internet -- on blogs, forum websites and the Twitter-like microblog service Weibo,\" recalls Goldkorn, a long-time observer of China\\'s social networking sites. \"The public expressed outrage on the Internet, and the traditional news media and the government reacted to the Internet coverage of the event.\" Despite the government\\'s efforts to contain the fallout, the incident drew widespread criticism among China\\'s estimated 420 million Internet users. \"My daddy is Li Gang\" became one of the top search items on most popular Chinese search engines, a viral catchphrase synonymous to abuse of power. Some composed sarcastic poems and songs. Others parodied the father-son duo in videos posted in cyberspace. The case became a cause célèbre among Internet users who viewed it as an example of official abuse. It also put the spotlight on the growing gap between the rich and the poor. Chen Lin, the victim\\'s 23-year-old brother, complained: \"In society they say everyone is equal, but in every corner there is inequality. How can you live in this country and this society without any worry? I feel like there should be deep reflection on this. This is the reality.\" Beijing resident Yang Ning, a white-collar worker, agrees. \"The case is symbolic,\" he tells me. \"In China it\\'s all about who your father is. Without a good father, you already lose at the starting line. Without a good father, you have to work 10 times harder than those born with good fathers.\" The Chinese authorities have tried to assuage the public ire. Days after the accident, the China Central Television showed Li under police detention, profusely apologizing and expressing remorse. His father Li Gang also appeared in a nationally broadcast TV interview, breaking down and bowing deeply to apologize to the victim\\'s family. \"As for my child\\'s education, as a father I failed,\" he cried. \"I am very sad, very guilty, very ashamed.\" He promised not to shield his son from the law. In November, according to Chinese media reports, Li Gang reached a civil settlement with the victim\\'s families, agreeing to pay 460,000 yuan (US$67,700) in restitution for the Chen family and 92,000 yuan (US$14,000) to Zhang\\'s family. He did not attend Wednesday\\'s court hearing. The victim\\'s brother Chen Lin attended. \"My family and I want justice,\" he was quoted by the Chinese media as saying. The state prosecutor asked for a three-to-seven year prison sentence for Li, according to the Xinhua News Agency, while the defendant\\'s lawyer called for leniency, noting that he has expressed remorse and compensated the victims\\' families. It is not known how soon the court will render its sentence. Years ago, incidents like this would have been non-events. Victims would have been intimidated and forgotten. Not this time. \"This is another landmark example of the Internet playing a significant role in curbing official abuses,\" says Goldkorn of Danwei. With the Internet and social network sites at the disposal of millions of ordinary citizens, abusive officials and their children are now getting caught in the act more and more often. \"There have been enough similar cases over the last few years that -- according to Chinese media reports -- some government officials have now acquired \\'Internet phobia,\\'\" observes Goldkorn. \"They fear of having their wrongdoings exposed by angry netizens.\" But Beijing resident Yang Ning is enthused: \"I raise my hand and shout: Long live the Internet!\"',\n",

       " {'article': \"Philip Levine, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose intimate portraits of blue-collar life were grounded in personal experience and political conscience - died at his Fresno, California home on Saturday, at age 87. Former US poet laureate from 2011 to 2012, Levine passed away from pancreatic and liver cancer, his wife said Sunday. He was among the country's most decorated poets, winning the Pulitzer in 1995 for The Simple Truth and the National Book Awards for the 1979 collection Ashes and for What Work Is. Levine's other honors included the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for lifetime achievement and a National Book Critics Circle Award. Philip Levine (pictured in 2006), a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose intimate portraits of blue-collar life were grounded in personal experience and political conscience, died at his California home on Saturday at age 87. While he taught in several colleges, Levine had little in common with the academic poets of his time, as he was not abstract, insular or digressive. Levine captured the ways 'ordinary people are extraordinary,' while writing poems that are accessible to readers, said Edward Hirsch, a friend of Levine and president of the Guggenheim Foundation.\\xa0'They move between the most ordinary diction and high romantic heights.' He added: 'We've lost a great presence in American poetry.' Born in Detroit in 1928 and the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Levine was profoundly shaped by his working-class childhood and years spent working in jobs ranging from driving a truck to assembling parts at a Chevrolet plant. As a poet, he consciously modeled himself after Walt Whitman, as he strove to be a writer of everyday experience and cosmic wonder. This was evident in his tactile, conversational poems that focused on his childhood, living in Spain, marriage, parenting and poetry itself. Levine was also a lover of the earth and sky as much as any poet of nature, but his poems explored the pangs of work and workers, such as Buying and Selling or Saturday Sweeping, in which employees toil under a leaky roof and 'blue hesitant light.' In What Work Is, the title piece of his celebrated 1991 collection, he offers a grim sketch of standing on line in the rain, hoping for a job: . This is about waiting, . shifting from one foot to another. Feeling the light rain falling like mist . into your hair, blurring your vision . until you think you see your own brother . ahead of you, maybe ten places. The former poet laureate from 2011 to 2012 passed away from pancreatic and liver cancer, his wife said Sunday. He was among the country's most decorated poets, winning the Pulitzer in 1995 for The Simple Truth and National Book Awards for the 1979 collection Ashes and for What Work Is . Levine's father, who was an auto-parts salesman, died when he was five years old.\\xa0And although his mother found work as an office manager, he remembered his childhood as 'a succession of moves from first a house to a series of ever-shrinking apartments.' As a kid, he was scrawny and imagined himself in peril on the streets of Detroit, 'the most anti-Semitic city west of Munich.' He would picture himself walking home from school with a rifle, shooting at Cadillacs, Lincolns and other cars owned by rich people. By the end 1942, when he was 14, and had worked at a soap factory and, like a first kiss, he discovered poetry. Levine became fond of it while attending Detroit's Central High School in 1945, after a teacher let him borrow a book by poet Wilfred Owen,\\xa0according to the Detroit Free Press. He would walk the streets late at night, speaking to the 'moon and stars about the emotional revolution that was raging' inside him. Levine later attended Wayne State University, where he read the verse of Stephen Crane, T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams, and 'immersed' himself in the history of poetry. 'I believed even then that if I could transform my experience into poetry I would give it the value and dignity it did not begin to possess on its own,' he later observed. The exhausting factory hours made Levine so determined to write that he showed up in 1953 at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop even though a planned fellowship had fallen through. He was told he could sign up for one course, but he enrolled in three, and Poet John Berryman became his mentor. 'He seemed to feel I had something genuine,' Levine told The Paris Review in 1988, 'but that I wasn't doing enough with it, wasn't demanding enough from my work. He kept directing me to poetry that would raise my standards.' As a poet, he (pictured in 1999) consciously modeled himself after Walt Whitman, as he strove to be a writer of everyday experience and cosmic wonder. This was evident in his tactile, conversational poems that focused on his childhood, living in Spain, marriage, parenting and poetry itself . Levine's other honors included the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for lifetime achievement (above Levine pictured in 1987 after receiving the prize) and a National Book Critics Circle Award . Poet Yvor Winters allowed Levine to stay with him at his home in California and also selected him for a Stanford Writing Fellowship in 1958. Around the same time, Levine joined the faculty of California State in Fresno and remained there for more than 30 years. He also taught at Princeton University and Columbia University among other colleges. Levine was married twice, to Patty Kanterman and to Frances J. Artley, his wife since 1954. He is survived by Artley, his twin brother Edward and another brother Eli, his three sons, Mark, John and Teddy, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild, according to the\\xa0New York Times. Levine's debut collection On the Edge came out in 1963, and other books included Not This Pig, They Feed the Lion and 1933. During a time in the 1960s, he spent time in Spain, and developed a deep bond to the country and to its people, especially those who had fought Francisco Franco during the country's civil war of the 1930s. He wrote poems about Spain and helped translate works by the Spanish poets Gloria Fuertes and James Sabines. When he was back in the US, Levine was an opponent of the Vietnam War and defender of civil rights and the rights of working people. In Coming Home, Detroit 1968, he took in 'the charred faces' and 'eyes boarded up' of his hometown, which had been devastated by riots the year before. In 1968, he also was among the writers who vowed not to pay taxes until the Vietnam War ended. 'I can remember feeling full of the power of a just cause and believing that power would not fail me. It failed me or I failed it. We didn't really change the way Americans lived, unless you take hairstyles seriously,' he once said. 'I'm not a man of action; it finally comes down to that. I'm not so profoundly moral that I can often overcome my fears of prison or torture or exile or poverty. I'm a contemplative person who goes in the corner and writes.'\",\n",

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- When it comes to deciding where the money goes, the Lotus Formula One team says its main priority is the car -- not the star driver who sits in the cockpit. Kimi Raikkonen said last week that he decided to leave it and rejoin Ferrari for the 2014 season because Lotus \"haven\\'t got my salary.\" But the team, owned by Luxembourg-based investment group Genii Capital, has now responded by explaining that it prefers to focus its finances on developing the car, even if it means seeing their driving talent walk away. Raikkonen has posted Lotus\\' only victory this year, with himself and the team both fourth in the respective driver and constructor standings. \"Our suppliers and key people who develop the car were our priority -- maybe not Kimi,\" Lotus team principal Eric Boullier told the official F1 website. \"Kimi was in a similar position last year and it was all settled by the end of the year. And Genii had the plan to do the same this year. \"It is public knowledge by now that we\\'ve been late in paying him, and he got upset. \"To manage the cash flow -- and I don\\'t mean the money itself or the budget we have, which is guaranteed by Genii, or at least most of it as we don\\'t have the revenue stream to allow us to live independently from Genii -- this cash flow is an issue if you have fixed costs and want to keep up the development level. \"You have to decide where you want to spend your money.\" Genii Capital took full control of the team -- which has raced in F1 since 1981 under its previous guises Toleman, Benetton and Renault -- from previous owner Renault in 2011. Ownership by a private investment company, instead of car manufacturers such as Mercedes and Fiat, which owns Ferrari, or a global company such as Red Bull, can provide a more risky financial backdrop for an F1 team. But Boullier says that Lotus\\' alternative business model does not mean it is mired in a financial crisis, as the rumors circulating in the sport would suggest. \"Red Bull or Mercedes, those companies are sponsoring the teams,\" said Boullier, whose driver management company Gravity also has connections to Genii. \"Genii has a different strategy: they loan the money. \"It is part of the strategy that partners join the team and Genii will get back their investment. \"Seventy-five percent of the debt Lotus has comes from Genii. They could write it off tomorrow by saying this money is a sponsorship -- and then our debt would be drastically reduced. Our normal debt is similar to most of the other teams.\" Genii\\'s strategy of choosing to bankroll the team before looking for sponsorship deals to recoup their investment is a gamble. Having 2007 world champion Raikkonen on board would have inevitably helped attract sponsors, but now Boullier is looking at alternatives. He says the team plans to emulate the business strategy of some of rivals, including Red Bull and McLaren, by looking for a title sponsor. \"It is no secret that for quite a while Genii have been looking for partners to make sure that we can bring more money to the team and have access to a bigger sponsor portfolio,\" the Frenchman added. \"We need to secure sponsors, as this is the only way to step up. \"Formula One depends massively on the people -- and to attract the best people to a team you need to have money, to be able to build something for the long term. \"Genii\\'s plan was to bring the team up within five years -- which we are trying to do -- but to move to the next step you need another five-year plan in place. And that is what we are working on.\"',\n",

       " {'article': '(CNN) -- A 48-year-old Utah man was arrested after police said his attempt to abduct a little girl was foiled by the child\\'s stepfather. Troy Mitchell Morley is suspected of two felonies -- child kidnapping and burglary, the Sandy, Utah, police department said in a written statement. \"The motive for the abduction and intentions of the suspect towards the child are not known,\" police said in the suburban Salt Lake City community. A spokesman for the family told CNN affiliate KSL on Friday afternoon that the girl was OK. \"At this moment, she seems pretty healthy and pretty happy,\" Miles Holman told the station. Police said there was no connection between Morley and the family. According to a news release from the Sandy police, Morley broke into the family\\'s home around 4:30 a.m. Friday and found the girl sleeping in the basement. He woke the girl and told her to come with him, the statement said. The girl\\'s parents were awakened by the sound of the front door and the stepfather saw the assailant carrying his daughter across the front lawn. In the 911 call attained by CNN affiliate KUTV, the girl\\'s mother describes the moment when she and her husband realize something is wrong. \"We heard the front door open and I heard her talking. She\\'s just the sweetest little thing. I heard her voice and we ran out,\" the sobbing woman says. The dad confronted the suspect and the man let go of the girl and ran. He was unarmed, the 911 caller says. \"But he was saying something that he\\'s messed up and someone\\'s going to hurt him,\" she tells the dispatcher. The man was later caught while hiding in another home after crawling through a doggie door, authorities said. KSL spoke to the home owner. \"I went downstairs, and he was crouched up, kind of by the back door with no shirt on. And he just said like, \\'Am I bad? Am I in trouble?\\' I just started screaming and ran up the stairs and told my husband, \\'There\\'s a man in the house,\\'\" Tina Olsen told KSL. After Morley refused to come out, a sheriff\\'s canine went in and bit the suspect on the shoulder and upper right arm, police said. Morley is being held in the Salt Lake County Jail and hasn\\'t had a preliminary hearing, said Sgt. Cammie Skogg, a spokeswoman for Salt Lake County Sheriff\\'s Office. CNN\\'s John Newsome contributed to this report.',\n",
