In her court hearing on Thursday Harper's appointed . attorney, Gerald Melton, described the children\u2019s' death as a 'tragic . accident,' the\u00a0Daily News Journal reports. Harper faces two counts of especially aggravated child . abuse. Three-year-old Daniel Marise and her . two-year-old sister Savannah were found dead by their mother after . having been left there for more than an hour. Officials said temperatures outside the vehicle would have been in the mid 90s, but far hotter inside. 'You . put someone in a car with the windows rolled up, with no ventilation, . it can increase the temperature easy 30 to 40 degrees inside the . vehicle,' said Smyrna police spokesman Sgt.

Harper's aunt, Estella Ship, told News Channel 5 she still does not fully understand what happened and believes Harper was a good mother who loved her children. 'I just know her and I know her mother, and she wouldn't do that, she wanted babies every since she was a baby,' she said. Smyrna police say Harper has no criminal history.

        "article": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's main Shiite parties Monday announced the formation of a new alliance that excludes the prime minister -- at least for now. Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari announces the new Iraqi National Alliance in Baghdad. The coalition, named the Iraqi National Alliance, was formed to compete in the country's national elections in January. It includes top Shiite parties, but not Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Dawa party. Senior political leaders who announced the alliance in a televised meeting said they still are holding talks with Dawa and other parties. The coalition replaces the powerful Iranian-backed Shiite United Iraqi Alliance -- of which Dawa was a part -- that swept the country's 2005 polls but later disintegrated. The new coalition was being presented as a nonsectarian one that includes a broader representation. \"This Iraqi National Alliance is a coalition of political forces from all aspects of Iraqi society,\" Ahmed al-Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress, which is part of this alliance, said on Monday. \"It is not an Islamic alliance like the previous one. It includes liberal groups, it aims to be nonsectarian, it has many representatives of other communities of Iraq in it.\" For now, the alliance is mainly made of top Shiite parties with a few small secular, Sunni and other parties. The announcement came after months of intense negotiations between the country's Shiite parties and recent reports of disagreements between al-Maliki's Dawa and other Shiite parties on who would lead the alliance. The alliance includes the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, former Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Fadhila party and others. Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, addressing the meeting, said he wished the Dawa party had been present at Monday's announcement, but negotiations will continue. Jalal al-Deen al-Sagheer, a senior Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq member, said al-Maliki was at talks held Sunday and that the prime minister congratulated participants, promising to have another meeting in the coming weeks. Hasan al-Sneid, a spokesman for al-Maliki's State of Law Coalition, also confirmed that negotiations are continuing. In a news conference later Monday, al-Sneid said there was no \"strategic disagreement,\" but rather disagreements over \"mechanisms of participation\" and wanting wider representation in the alliance. He denied this has to do with al-Maliki going for a second term or leadership of the alliance. The prime minister's State of Law Coalition, which mainly includes members of his Dawa party, won control of most of the country's provincial councils in January's elections, turning back mainly Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq opposition. Al-Maliki, whose campaigning in the last elections trumpeted recent security gains and a drastic drop in violence, has been affected by a series of deadly attacks in Baghdad and in northern Iraq. Absent from Monday's major announcement were two of the most influential Shiite leaders, al-Sadr and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim. Al-Sadr, who fled to Iran in 2007, is continuing religious studies there. Al-Hakim, the former head of the United Iraqi Alliance who has been receiving cancer treatment in Iran, has been hospitalized there after his health deteriorated, his party announced Sunday.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Syria has destroyed a majority of its chemical weapons material, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Saturday. \"The Syrian Arab Republic has removed or destroyed in-country approximately 80 percent of its chemical weapons material,\" according to the OPCW Executive Council. The OPCW also said Saturday that the regime of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is now on track to complete the disposal of the country's chemical weapons in the next few days. If that happens, Syria would meet the deadline set by the OPCW for the destruction of the weapons before the end of April. \"The renewed pace in movements is positive and necessary to ensure progress towards a tight deadline,\" said Sigrid Kaag, special coordinator of the OPCW-U.N. Joint Mission in Damascus. In March, Syria submitted to the OPCW a revised proposal for its chemical weapons disposal with a deadline at the end of April. That revised deadline proposal followed a February report by the OPCW that the country had shipped out just 11% of its weapons stockpile for disposal, falling far short of a February 5 deadline to have all such weapons removed. The slow pace of removal prompted U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to warn in January that all options remain available to force compliance. Al-Assad agreed to get rid of all of Syria's chemical weapons last fall to avoid a possible U.S. military strike against the regime. Attacks in Syria claim at least 13 lives . As the country remains on track for disposal of its chemical weapons, the violence in the years-long civil war rages on. Attacks in three cities Saturday killed at least 13 people and injured dozens more. A car bomb exploded in Hama Saturday, killing four people and injuring nine others, a source at Hama Police Command told SANA, Syria's national news agency. The bomb targeted a convoy of four trucks carrying humanitarian aid workers with the Syrian Red Crescent organization. Mortar shelling and rocket attacks on neighborhoods in Homs left six people dead and at least 40 others injured. A car bomb also exploded near a mosque in Homs Saturday, according to SANA. An unknown number of casualties are reported in that attack. Three people were killed, including a 3-year-old child, and more than a dozen injured in mortar attacks on neighborhoods in Aleppo, according to SANA. SANA is also reported attacks in Daraa and Damascus Saturday injured at least 24 people, including 14 children. French journalists released . Four French journalists held hostage in Syria for the past 10 months are now on their way home. Journalists Edouard Elias, Didier Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois, Nicolas Henin and Pierre Torres are in good health despite the tough conditions they endured during their captivity, the Elysee Palace said in a statement released Saturday. The men were taken hostage last June. French President Francois Hollande learned of the journalists' release with \"great relief,\" the statement said. The Elysee Palace also said the men are on their way home to France. Francois, a reporter, and Elias, a photographer, were on assignment in Syria for French radio station Europe 1 when they disappeared on June 6, 2013. They were en route to Aleppo and had already crossed the Turkish border into Syria when they vanished, according to the radio station. Reporter Henin and photographer Torres were taken hostage a short time later, on June 22, the French Foreign Ministry said last October. Henin was working on assignment for Le Point magazine and the TV channel Arte, while Torres was there to cover municipal elections, the ministry said. Syria was the most deadly nation in the world for journalists on the job in 2013. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported 29 journalists died covering the conflict there in 2013, including some who died in Lebanon or Turkey. The report says more than 60 have died covering the war in Syria so far. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- This wouldn't be L.A., folks, if there wasn't a manufactured drama behind the drama that's Carmaggedon. So, two CNN producers decided to hold a cross-town race (after all, they are a competitive bunch) and see who could finish first. One took a plane: A $4 flight under a special Carmaggedon deal offered by JetBlue Airways. The other drove a car. The distance was 37.3 miles -- by car -- between the airports of Burbank, California, and Long Beach, California. The obstacle to this CNN Great Race was potential gridlock from this weekend's closure of Interstate 405, due to an ongoing $1.2 billion expansion project. Which would win, car or plane? On a typical day, it would be a fair race, given Los Angeles' notoriously clogged highways. But on Saturday, the \"Carmaggedon\" yielded to a \"Carmaheaven\" as motorists stayed home. That favored four wheels over two wings. The automobile beat the airplane by 47 minutes. In fact, the producer who drove the car was returning home by the time the plane arrived. \"This went so smoothly, you can't believe it,\" Paul Vercammen reported from behind the wheel. His time: \"54 minutes in an absolute piece of cake.\" And that included time lost on taking a wrong ramp, getting some water and messing with camera equipment, he said. \"I would say that if traffic was like this all the time, people would be happy to take such adventures on a Friday,\" he added. While the car may have been king on this day, the airplane had the better party. \"Even though Paul won,\" said producer Lindy Hall, \"we are having more fun. I know it. There has been huge receptions at every gate. Tons of food. There's a convivial atmosphere everywhere.\" And, she added: \"When's the last time you got a gift bag\" on a flight? Maybe one reason the plane lost was because it took the scenic route. \"We flew over the 405, and it was completely empty,\" Hall said. She added how passengers on the plane even had a bird's eye view of crews tearing down the Mulholland Drive bridge over the 405. Mulholland Drive is often featured in Hollywood films. The race began at 11:20 a.m. PT, because that's when Hall arrived at the Burbank's Bob Hope Airport, one hour before flight time. The sold-out Flight 405 (that number is correct) of JetBlue departed at 12:20 p.m. PT, for a trip lasting 45 minutes gate-to-gate, to Long Beach Airport. But Vercammen enjoyed a fast start, reporting from his vehicle that Los Angeles' highways were a ghost town, relatively speaking. \"I'm getting on the (Interstate) 5 freeway. I believe that most everyone has been intimidated by this Carmaggedon talk,\" Vercammen said at about 11:30 a.m. \"I don't know how fair this test is going to be,\" he added. Shortly after noon, Vercammen was victorious, easily defeating the airplane. His time was 54 minutes, compared with one hour 41 minutes for Hall. \"While I may be losing this battle, I'm having way more fun,\" Hall said from the plane shortly before takeoff, describing refreshments and a cake with a depiction of a car-choked 405. On the plane, passengers found on their seats a gift bag that included cookies saying \"405,\" chips and water. As a longtime Angeleno, Vercammen waxed poetically about the 405, a sentiment shared by many in town: \"I avoid the 405 like poison oak, or wild-eyed people you randomly meet on story shoots who want you to pitch their product. \"The 405 is a time bandit, a concrete thief that steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic.\" But not today.",

The five-time National Basketball Association champion, who injured his shoulder last week in a loss to the Pelicans in New Orleans, underwent a procedure lasting two hours. Kobe Bryant had surgery on  a torn rotator cuff on Wednesday and will miss the rest of the season . LA Lakers superstar (right) sustained the injury during his team's 96-80 defeat by the New Orleans Pelicans . 36-year-old holds his right shoulder in pain after suffering the injury against New Orleans . 'I expect Kobe to make a full recovery and if all goes as expected, he should be ready for the start of the season,' said Dr Neal ElAttrache, who performed the surgery. Bryant was averaging 22.3 points in 35 games this season for a struggling Lakers team that is last in the Pacific Division with a 12-34 record. The Lakers formally declared Bryant out for the year by acknowledging the expected recovery time from his injury, but also effectively confirmed he won't retire and will attempt to play his 20th season in the fall. Bryant, who will be 37 years old this summer, is the NBA's highest-paid player at $23.5 million this season, and he is under contract for $25 million next year. Bryant was averaging 22.3 points from 35 games this season for a struggling Lakers team . 'In my mind right now, he's coming back next year, unless he tells me something different,' said coach Byron Scott. The 36-year-old guard, who earned his 17th All-Star selection last week, had sat out eight of the Lakers' previous 16 games for 'rest' reasons. Fourth on the NBA's all-time scoring list, he played in only six games last season due to knee and Achilles tendon injuries as Los Angeles posted a 27-55 record. The former league most valuable player, who joined the Lakers as a first-round pick out of high school as an 18-year-old in 1996, is signed through next season after agreeing to a two-year extension in 2013 for $48.5 million.",

A woman in Arizona was swept away by water when she and her husband tried to drive through a flooded area on Monday, and the vehicle was picked up by the water, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said. Both exited the vehicle, and the man, 69, made it to safety, but his wife, 76, was unable to. Another Arizona woman was killed after her car was submerged in floodwaters, the Tucson Fire Department said. Rescuers were unable to reach the vehicle in time. \"Within a minute of us getting there, the car washed away,\" Capt. Barrett Baker told CNN. The waters were up to 12-feet deep, he said, and pushed the car for several blocks. Record-setting rains left up to 200 children trapped briefly in an elementary school in Moapa, Nevada, on Monday. The students at Perkins Elementary school, about 60 miles from Las Vegas, were with teachers and were not in danger, said Highway Patrol Spokesman Loy Hixson. Flash flooding also washed away a portion of Interstate 15 near the community of Glendale, taking several vehicles with it.

        "article": "By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 20:20 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:58 EST, 25 October 2013 . A lot of married couples talk about being 'saved' by each other, but newlyweds Kyle Froelich and Chelsea Clair mean it literally. If Kyle had never met Chelsea there's a good chance he wouldn't be alive today since she provided a much-needed kidney transplant when his had almost completely stopped working. The two were married this past October 12, four years after they first met and three years after that life-saving organ donation. Commitment: Kyle Froelich married Chelsea Clair in a ceremony earlier this month. The couple met four years ago and on the day they met, Chelsea offered to donate her kidney to the ailing Kyle . In an interview with the Indianapolis Star, the couple talked about the day they met - September 12, 2009. At the time Kyle was in his last year of high school in Brownsburg, Indiana, and what doctor's believed was his last year of life. He met Chelsea at a car show, when the 22-year-old friend of a friend was going through a divorce. After hanging out with Kyle that day, Chelsea offered him her kidney as they were parting. He didn't think much of it though. Many people had offered him a kidney in the past and he learned not to get his hopes up. Meant to be: The kidney donation was a success as the two were a near perfect match, medically and, eventually, romantically . Chelsea was different though. She followed through and got tested and it turned out that the two were 'an almost perfect match'. Part of her commitment to donating her kidney was the fact that her father passed away after never finding a bone marrow transplant. But it wasn't an easy road to donation. After watching a video of a kidney operation, Chelsea's mother told her not to do it and that caused the mother and daughter to become distant. 'I felt like I had nobody,' Chelsea said. The two went into surgery six months after first meeting, and Kyle drove Chelsea to Indiana University hospital that day. A perfect match: The surgery was a success and Kyle's body accepted Chelsea's kidney immediately . Once at the hospital, Chelsea started to panic. She was going to be the first one operated on, and before being wheeled away into the OR, she grabbed onto Kyle and said 'Please don't let go'. The donation that brought them together: The two officially started dating after the kidney operation . Despite Chelsea's fears, the operation was a success and Kyle's body accepted the new kidney immediately. When they both awoke after the procedure, their first words were about each other. 'Is Kyle OK?' Chelsea asked. 'How's Chelsea?' Kyle said. While . recovering the two had to be kept separate so Kyle wouldn't get an . infection but he kept asking the nurses to wheel him past Chelsea so he . could wave into her room. It wasn't until after the donation that the two became an item. 'There's a bond that no one else, unless they've done it, can know. She's my best friend,' Kyle said. In . addition to other milestones of their relationship, the two now . celebrate the anniversary of the kidney transplant, a day they call . 'Sparkypalooza' (they named the kidney Sparky). It's become a sort-of inside joke between the two. Chelsea often threatens to take back the kidney. 'He's carrying around my kidney. I have to make sure he takes of that,' Chelsea said. Three years after Chelsea gave Kyle her kidney, the two exchanged vows at the Danville Conservation Club . At . their wedding ceremony on October 12, the couple opted out of the . traditional vows of 'in sickness and in health' and wrote something . meaningful to them: 'I offer you my hand, my heart and my soul, as I . know they will be safe with you.'",

        "article": "A Colorado boy's mother led him to believe he was cancer-stricken and was used by her to raise at least $25,000, investigators said - and now she has pleaded guilty to fraud. Sandy Thi Nguyen pleaded guilty to both child abuse and charitable fraud charges Friday, The Denver Post reported, Friday, with her sentencing set for a November date. Scroll down for video . Faker: Sandy Thi Nguyen, pictured, pleaded guilty to fraud. She reportedly ran a scheme saying her son had cancer in order to obtain thousands of dollars . Scam: Nguyen used $16,000 and also took her family on a Disneyland trip, the Arapahoe County Sheriff's said . The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said in a March release 'it was discovered that [Nguyen] did convince her son, family and community that her 6-year-old had cancer and was receiving cancer treatment since approximately September 2012.' One year later, 'over $25,000' was gathered by Aurora residents, the sheriff's office said. However, the sheriff's office revealed that 'Over the last several months, Ms. Nguyen accepted at least $16,000.00 from that account as well as a trip to Disneyland for herself and her family, which was paid for by the donated funds.' $23,000 was found inside her home 'and in a subsequent interview, [Nguyen] admitted that her son does not have cancer, and stated that some of the money recovered was from donations received,' the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said. Bogus: The story of Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race . Hoax: Nguyen allegedly falsely posted online a list of cancer treatments for her son . Nguyen's son, in excerpts of an arrest affidavit published by CBS Denver, said 'he believes he has cancer and is going to die' and was under the impression he received nightly chemotherapy treatments. The boy also revealed 'his mom shaves his head every morning before school,' according to the published excerpts. 7NewsDenver\u00a0reported  Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race, and that she posted 'updates' on his treatment online. The principal of the boy's school, Darla Thompson, said in a letter published by the station 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community.' 'But the allegations do not, in any way, diminish the concern and support demonstrated by the Rolling Hills community for a child believed to be facing a life-threatening challenge. 'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parent\u2019s alleged actions.'",

The brave Belgian Malnois was one of two K-9's that took down White House intruder Dominic Adesanya, 23, who scaled the north fence and sprinted across the lawn on Wednesday night in a bid to reach the executive mansion, where President Obama and the first family were at the time. Jordan and fellow dog Hurricane, who can both sprint 25 miles per hour and have a bite that applies hundreds of pounds of pressure per square inch, quickly took down the Maryland man, who suffers from mental problems and was arrested two months earlier for another White House security breach. Adesanya tried to fight off the police dogs, kicking Jordan in the snout and slamming Hurricane to the ground before punching him repeatedly. Scroll down for video . Bouncing back: A secret service dog believed to be injured K-9 Jordan is seen back on the job outside the White House on Friday after thwarting an intruder on Wednesday night . Answering orders: The dog believed to be Jordan springs to action for his minder . Integral: The White House K-9's can run up to 25 miles an hour . Sit: Jordan and Hurricane were both assaulted by a White House intruder on Wednesday . Cleared: The dogs and their injuries were assessed and both were cleared for duty . Rest: The\u00a0Belgian Malnois chills out on the lawn outside the White Fence on Friday . Job well done: Jordan, left, and Hurricane, right, have returned to work after stopping a White House intruder on Wednesday. The dogs were treated for minor bruises after the intruder kicked and punched them . They were treated for minor bruises, but have now headed back to work, the Secret Service said. On Friday, a dog believed to be Hurricane was seen back on the job outside the White House. The K-9 eagerly answered orders from a minder and appeared to be injury-free. On Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest praised the agents' response, saying, 'Yesterday's incident underscores the professionalism of the Secret Service.' As the agency shared photos of the dogs on Twitter, it revealed that Jordan, a five-year-old black and tan Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys walks around White House'. Stopped:\u00a0Dominic Adesanya, who has a history of mental illness, remains in police custody . Hurricane, a six-year-old black Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys playing with his Kong toy', the Twitter feed said. The agency noted both are 'ready to work'. Adesanya, from Bel Air, Maryland, is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and has been charged with felony assault on a police officer for hurting the dogs. He is being held without bond. He was unarmed when he tried to reach the White House. After his arrest, his father revealed that Adesanya had the paranoid belief he was being watched by cameras and had previously been arrested at the executive mansion. He was arrested on July 27 and ordered to undergo mental health screening.\u00a0Court records show he told an officer that he wanted cameras that had been placed in his home removed. The document also says he told an officer that the security barrier he jumped over 'was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well.' After the arrest he was ordered to get outpatient mental health screening . He was apprehended again on July 30 after he refused to leave the Treasury building,  next to the White House, and swung his fists at officers. Cruel: Video footage captured Adesanya kicking one of the dogs and punching another on the lawn . Dogs have been working for the Secret Service since 1975. The agency trains Belgian Malinois, like Hurricane and Jordan. While the breed is known for its gentle nature, the dogs can also run 30 miles and have a 270-degree field of vision, making them effective at hunting down targets. They resemble small German shepherds and their short hair allows them to work well in the heat. One was used in the team that cornered Osama bin Laden in 2011. Secret Service dogs must complete 20 weeks of training with handlers before they can report for duty. They complete eight hours a week of refresher training once they're on the job. On average, they work until they are about 10. This means that Hurricane, who's six, and Jordan, who's five, have a few more years of work left in them yet. He was supposed to return to court  but didn't show up and warrants for his arrest were issued. His father, Victor Adesanya, said in a telephone interview that his son has been experiencing mental health problems for over a year, but he refused the help the family tried to get for him. Victor Adesanya said his son was diagnosed with paranoia and schizophrenia and 'complained about cameras everywhere.' He said at one point his son took down a mirror in the bathroom and cut into the wall, trying to find a camera. He also looked for them in the family's attic. He said his son was not trying to hurt the president. 'He's not violent. He's not a criminal. He's not a murderer. He's just someone that's just mentally disturbed,' he said. The incident came about a month after a previous White House fence jumper, Omar Gonzalez, sprinted across the same lawn carrying a knife, ran past armed uniformed agents and entered the mansion before being felled in the ceremonial East Room and taken into custody. This week a federal judge delayed his arraignment because of questions about his mental fitness. Friends and family said the veteran was suffering from PTSD due to service abroad. Security: A member of the U.S. Secret Service stands guard in front of the North Lawn of the White House in Washington on Thursday, a day after Adesanya jumped over the fence and tried to reach the mansion . The embarrassing  incident preceded the disclosure of other serious Secret Service breaches in security for Obama and ultimately led to Julia Pierson's resignation as director of the agency after 18 months on the job. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who has been leading congressional investigations into the Secret Service, commended the swift response Wednesday night. But he said more needed to be known about Dominic Adesanya, including whether he was doing anything suspicious immediately before the incident that should have led to his detection. Chaffetz also suggested changes might be needed to 'maximize the pain of going over the fence.' 'It seems a little too easy to get over,' he said.",

        "article": "Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian protesters are vowing to continue their anti-government demonstrations into Wednesday night, despite violent crackdowns and arrests. Witnesses in Tehran tell CNN the demonstrators number in the tens of thousands. The protests are timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy. Iran celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday, and tens of thousands showed up to hear anti-American speeches in front of the building that once housed the U.S. diplomatic corps. Many chanted \"Death to America.\" The anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in June, following a disputed presidential election. Thousands of protesters ignored warnings from Iranian authorities to stay home, many chanting \"Death to the Dictator\" and others saying, \"Obama - Either you're with us or with them,\" referring to the U.S. president. Riot police and pro-government Basij militia turned out in force to quash anti-government protests. \"We were running from the police in the alleys off of the main streets,\" said Soheil, an opposition protester, who gave only one name for security reasons. \"Strangers were opening up their garages so we could hide until the police went away. I ran into a garage for about 15 minutes. When I went back into the main street, I saw riot police arresting a group of young men, then putting them inside a bank and locking the door. \"Only God knows what will happen to them after that.\" iReport: Iranians take to the streets . Soheil, like many other of the demonstrators, took part in the protests this summer. As with previous demonstrations, many images of Wednesday's protest were uploaded to the Internet on the site YouTube.com -- including video of protesters walking over an image of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Another clip showed a group of women being beaten by what appeared to be Iranian security forces. Witnesses said many Iranian women took part in Wednesday's demonstration, and were frequently targeted by the Iranian security forces -- which is what also happened during the summer protests. Video posted on YouTube showed many protesters beaten on the head with batons. Iranian reformists have chosen key anniversaries to protest the hardline government -- the same anniversaries chosen for government-sanctioned anti-American rallies. Wednesday's was the biggest annual anti-American observance of all. On November 4, 1979, Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy. They held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. There were also small pockets of protest on Wednesday in the southwest Iran city of Shiraz, according to a resident who witnessed the protests. Demonstrators marched down the main street of Shiraz, yelling \"Death to the dictator\" and \"We will not stand down to you, together we are united,\" according to Najmeh, who only gave her first name for security reasons. There was strong police presence on the streets, and the police force seemed much more organized than past occasions, she said. Earlier in the day, opposition supporters marched defiantly in Tehran's Haft-e-Tir Square, witnesses said. Many held up their hands in V-signs. Others shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" or \"God is great,\" which has become a slogan of protest. Police blocked all roads leading to the square, creating massive traffic jams. Witnesses described helmet-clad security personnel beating demonstrators with batons and firing tear gas at Haft-e-Tir Square and in a neighborhood a few kilometers north. \"I had never seen that many riot police and security personnel,\" a witness told CNN. \"They were brought in by the busloads. As soon as crowds gathered somewhere, riot police were there within minutes.\" The opposition showed Wednesday that even after five months of government crackdown, people were still willing to take risks. The disputed June 12 presidential election triggered Iran's most serious political crisis since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah. Led by opposition candidate Mir Houssein Moussavi, thousands of Iranians protested what they believed was a rigged vote that returned hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office for a second term. In the election aftermath, the Iranian government arrested more than 1,000 people and accused reformists Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling anger among the public. But despite warnings from the government, Iran's reformists have largely refused to back down. They released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government's official number. Both Moussavi and Karrubi were prevented from attending Wednesday's rallies, according to a reformist Web site, Norooz News. Karrubi's son told the Web site that his father tried to reach the Haft-e-Tir Square rally on foot, but he was blocked by anti-riot police, sparking clashes with his followers. Police fired tear gas toward Karrubi, hitting one of his guards on the head, and causing Karrubi and some of his supporters to fall to the ground, according to Norooz News. Karrubi and his followers returned to their vehicles and drove away when, at one point, security forces attacked and damaged Karrubi's vehicle, the Web site said. Video posted on YouTube showed Karrubi briefly opening his car door to a crowd of cheering supporters, who chanted, \"Honorable Karrubi, help the people of Iran.\" Iranian authorities had warned Karrubi to not participate in the marches, saying he might be the victim of a suicide attack, according to Norooz News. Moussavi was unable to join the demonstration after his car was prevented from leaving his office, according to his Facebook page and a report on a reformist Web site. Cell phone and Internet connections were cut in the area where his office is located, and dozens of plainclothes motorcycle riders blocked the entrance and chanted slogans against Moussavi, the Web sites said. Read analysis from Hamid Dabashi, author of \"Iran: A People Interrupted\" In Washington, President Obama said the world continues to bear witness to the Iranian people's \"calls for justice and their courageous pursuit of universal rights.\" \"Iran must choose,\" he said in a statement late Tuesday. \"We have heard for thirty years what the Iranian government is against; the question, now, is what kind of future it is for. \"It is time for the Iranian government to decide whether it wants to focus on the past, or whether it will make the choices that will open the door to greater opportunity, prosperity, and justice for its people,\" he said. Obama noted how the embassy takeover reshaped U.S.-Iranian relations. \"This event helped set the United States and Iran on a path of sustained suspicion, mistrust, and confrontation,\" he said. \"I have made it clear that the United States of America wants to move beyond this past, and seeks a relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran based upon mutual interests and mutual respect.\" Obama said America has demonstrated willingness to work with Iran over nuclear issues by recognizing its right to peaceful nuclear power and accepting a recent proposal by the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency. \"We have made clear that if Iran lives up to the obligations that every nation has, it will have a path to a more prosperous and productive relationship with the international community,\" Obama said. CNN's Reza Sayah, Sara Mazloumsaki, Mitra Mobasherat, and journalist Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Members of a small private school community in Pennsylvania are reeling after administrators claimed Monday that one of the school's founders engaged in a 'sexual relationship with a student' in the 1950s. The allegation was published in a letter on the website of the Solebury School, located an hour north of Philadelphia, which in recent months has been conducting investigations into a number of abuse allegations against teachers spanning multiple decades. Thomas Wilschutz, who currently heads the school, wrote that he is 'now ready to confirm' that a co-founder, Robert Shaw, had sexual relations with a student. Shocking: The small community of alumni and students of Solebury was rocked by allegations that its founder engaged in sexual relations with a student . The investigation into child abuse at Solebury began earlier in the year, when administrators brought allegations of abuse between the 1950s to the 1970s to the attention of police and the District Attorney's office of Bucks County, according to the  Courier Times. One former student from Solebury now in her 50s claims that she had sex with a male teacher in the 1970s, when he was in his mid-20s and she was 14, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'I was not raped,' she said, 'but it shouldn't have happened.' The student claims that the school never contacted her to discuss the allegations, though she came forward in the early 2000s. Another female student claims that she was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a Solebury teacher in the 2000s. Through a statement released by her lawyer, Jeff Fritz, she said that the school knew of the 'inappropriate contact' but failed to contact police or other officials. This is not the first time the school has dealt with issues of sexual abuse. In 1997, former theater teacher David . Chadwick was convicted for engaging in a sexual relationship with a . 15-year-old student in 1993. Close quarters: Collaboration and friendship were encouraged between students and teachers at Solebury, a private boarding school on 90 acres in Pennsylvania . The school says it is removing items that 'honor Robert Shaw,' including a portrait that hangs in the dining hall. Shaw passed away in 1982. School officials say that another deceased teacher is among those accused. Shaw was one of four co-founders of Solebury, which opened in 1925 with just four students. The boarding school is located on a 90 acre campus in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Solebury's website says that the mission was 'to start a small school with an informal atmosphere,' where 'friendship between teachers and pupils would be encouraged,' in the words of the school's first headmaster, Doc Washburn. In an earlier letter from July that revealed the allegations to the public, the school acknowledged that the policy of a 'close and collaborative relation' between students and teachers was integral to its mission, but put down the notion it excused sexual contact. 'We will not permit that ideal to be used as a proxy or a justification for an inappropriate sexual relationship between an adult and a student at Solebury School. Not in the past. Not now. Not in the future.'",

It comes after another day of high drama at the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) where Mr Owen admitted lying to the corruption watchdog about returning a wad of $100 notes worth about $10,000 that he received in a car from property developer Jeff McCloy. Mr Owen told ICAC\u00a0on Monday that either his campaign manager Hugh Thomson or former NSW police minister Mike Gallacher arranged the December 2010 deal. But in sensational evidence today at the hearing into Liberal Party funding and breaches of the electoral donation funding act in Sydney, he said the money was never given back but 'rolled into (his) campaign'. Mr Owen and current Newcastle mayor, Mr McCloy, agreed on Sunday that Mr Owen would tell ICAC he was given about $2,000 by the Newcastle mayor but returned it the next day. Scroll down for video . Suspended Liberal MP Tim Owen (right) leaving the Independent Commission Against Corruption hearing on Monday after giving evidence . Mr Owen and current Newcastle mayor, Jeff McCloy (pictured), agreed on Sunday that Mr Owen would tell ICAC he was given about $2,000 by the Newcastle mayor but returned it the next day . Quoting Mr Owen's evidence from Monday, Mr McCloy's lawyer asked 'if the words that follow... \"and then I went back to his house after that and basically dropped the envelope back in his letter box\", were false.' 'Yes. It was,\" the former the deputy commander of the Australian forces in Afghanistan and Iraq said. 'You said 'I think I just put a little note on it that said no thanks', that answer was false,' Mr McCloy's lawyer pressed. 'Correct,' Mr Owen said. During the Sunday meeting the men also discussed whether Mr McCloy should resign as Lord Mayor of Newcastle, the ICAC heard. Mr Owen denied he was asked by Mr McCloy to come clean about the cash. 'You said 'my wife will divorce me. I've sworn on a stack of bibles that I didn't receive any money\",' Mr McCloy's lawyer said. 'I didn't say that to him, no,' Mr Owen said. Mr Owen says he tried to make the statement on Monday afternoon but was cut off by counsel assisting the commission, Geoffrey Watson. A formal announcement on the parliamentary future of both Mr Owen and Dr Cornwell is expected later today. Both had already quit the Liberal Party and have now ended their terms in parliament prematurely, likely forcing Premier Mike Baird into by-elections for the seats of Charlestown and Newcastle. A general election is due to be held in March of next year.

SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. said Thursday Jim Atchison is stepping down as head of the company and named its chairman as interim leader. Attendance at its theme parks has been weak since the recession and has dropped in three of the past four quarters. SeaWorld has also been battling negative publicity since the release of 'Blackfish' last year, a documentary that suggested its treatment of animals may have led to the death of trainers. SeaWorld has been trying to combat the decline with a turnaround effort. It said Thursday that it will eliminate an unspecified number of jobs as part of previously announced cost cuts, which are expected to save $50 million annually. Scroll down for video .

The company would not say how many jobs it planned to cut. Jim Atchison has served as CEO and president since 2009. He will become vice chairman and will be nominated to the board of its independent nonprofit conservation fund. The Orlando Sentinel, citing a SEC filing, reported that Atchison's exit package includes a payment of $2.4million and a $440,000 consulting fee for three years. In a company release, Atchison said 'It has been an honor to lead SeaWorld. I am so proud of this Company and our dedicated team members. I look forward to serving as Vice Chairman and continuing to work with the Board, David, and our exceptional team to assure a smooth transition.' Chairman David D'Alessandro will take over as interim CEO January 15 and serve until a permanent replacement is found. D'Alessandro said in the release 'On behalf of the entire Board, I'd like to thank Jim for his contributions to the Company and express our ongoing support for our long-term strategy. Jim has helped the Company realize its vision of becoming a leader in the theme park industry, one of the world's foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal care.

He continued 'We remain committed to our growth agenda and enhancing value for our shareholders. The Board intends to complete the search process deliberately and thoughtfully to find the right individual with the experience and qualifications to lead the Company into the future.' The company on Thursday also appointed two new directors to its board: Ellen Tauscher, a former congresswoman from California, and former advertising executive William Gray. Gray has also been a senior adviser to Blackstone, an investment firm and minority shareholder in SeaWorld. Shares of SeaWorld, which operates 11 theme parks across the country, rose 16 cents in extended trading. Its stock closed Thursday up 45 cents to $16.09. The Orlando, Florida-based company's shares have lost about 45 percent in the past year. Gabriela Cowperthwaite, Blackfish's director, told The Hollywood Reporter Thursday 'As far as the restructuring, seems like they're rearranging chairs on the Titanic. I don't hear that they're shifting in step with an informed public. Meaningful change would involve sea sanctuaries and an entire shift toward rehab release programs. But If the new guard wants to shift the paradigm, I'm all ears.'",

The Hammers are desperate to keep hold of the 15-year-old from the clutches of the Premier League's elite. West Ham will open talks with Oxford's representatives over an improved deal at Upton Park, which could see the defender fast-tracked into the senior set-up. Rising star: Oxford in action for the West Ham development squad against Shakhtar Donetsk on Saturday . Hands off: David Sullivan has criticised bigger clubs for trying to poach West Ham's young talent . But Oxford has serious options to choose from, with United the latest club to show a firm interest in the teenager. Arsenal and Chelsea are also keen on the youngster, but United are thought to be leading the race for Oxford should he decide to quit the Hammers. Speaking earlier this month co-owner David Sullivan spoke of the club's intention to keep Oxford and blasted England's top sides for continually poaching the lesser clubs' best talent. 'It almost makes you give up on having an academy if they can come in and nick your best 15-year-old. What's the point?,' Sullivan said. Dilemma: Sam Allardyce is keen to keep Oxford at Upton Park but faces a struggle against the big boys . In the hunt: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are one of many top clubs interested in Oxford . The England Under-16 international has already trained with the club's first team and can expect more senior opportunities at Upton Park next season. Despite being 15, he has already turned out for West Ham's Under-18s side, as well as their U15s and U16s.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- On Tuesday afternoon, President Obama will meet with Republican Congressional leaders for the first time since the midterm election. The White House meeting had been dubbed the \"Slurpee summit,\" but it's going to take something stronger than a flavored ice shake to cut through the deep distrust that's accumulated between these two parties. The Kool-Aid that gets passed around Washington most often these days is the belief that our political opponents are sworn enemies. It is an idea compounded by partisan media that demonizes even minor disagreements. But it wasn't always this way. In the past, Democrats and Republicans could disagree on policies throughout the day, then meet together for a drink or dinner. Their children went to school together. Their families saw each other on the weekends or at worship services. But now congressmen fly home from Washington as often as possible. There is very little time for across-the-aisle socializing and much more time for accusing opponents of being socialist. Our political leaders don't get to know each other as people. That's where the cigarette comes in. It's a strange fact that Obama and speaker-elect John Boehner have been known to smoke, while the majority of Americans have given up this once common vice. It is a streak of illogic and self-destructiveness in otherwise disciplined and ambitious men who have climbed to the top of their field without wheezing. So if Boehner and Obama are both going to be tempted to sneak out for a smoke at some point during their bipartisan summit, here's a suggestion: Do it together. Have an honest off-the-record conversation and get to know each other as individuals. These two men come from very different backgrounds. Boehner was one of a dozen children whose father ran a bar in Ohio; Obama was raised by a single mother in Hawaii after his father returned to Africa. But they are both examples of the American dream, and they both love their country. Sharing a smoke is an opportunity to acknowledge that they're both hugely accomplished but still flawed individuals. It's an opportunity to admit that, yes, they have serious philosophical differences but that, for the good of the country, they need to find a way to work together, and that begins with a conversation. Unguarded, off-the-record socializing was an important reason the closely divided Congresses of the 1950s worked so effectively. Then Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson smoked and drank and played cards with his Republican counterparts. Of course, he was then considered a conservative southern Democrat, and that made it easier to reach across the aisle during the Eisenhower administration. The decline of both progressive Republicans and conservative Democrats has made the partisan gulf wider. But even in the epic philosophic fights that accompanied the Watergate era and the Reagan administration, House Speaker Tip O'Neill would famously have a drink with President Ford or President Reagan after a long day of principled differences and parliamentary maneuvers. It was a recognition of a forgotten American wisdom - that our political opponents are not our enemies. In contrast,  let's cite just one small recent example of how far we've fallen. On Monday, Republican Rep. Joe Barton created a PowerPoint presentation, first reported by the Huffington Post, in his bid to secure the chairmanship of the Energy Committee. It compared Republican congressional leaders to General Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley, and General George S. Patton in \"battle against the Obama administration.\" The only problem here is that this would, by implication, make the president and his Democratic allies the Nazi German army. This is unhelpful in creating a tone of mutual respect and constructive engagement. But we seem to be getting desensitized to such loaded comparisons. Once Obama and Boehner get past the interpersonal niceties, there is some common ground substance to discuss. Friendly recognition of Obama's decision to announce a two-year pay freeze for all federal workers would be a step in the right direction. It was a policy proposal advanced by many Republicans in recent months. It should be treated as the beginning of some good faith bargaining going forward. Likewise, there might be some compromise on extending the tax cuts for households that make less than $1 million a year. On the deficit and debt front, Obama and Boehner could agree to back the bipartisan deficit reduction panel if it comes back with proposals. The deep distrust and persuasive hyper-partisanship that has suffused our political debates makes that kind of common ground conversation almost impossible.  But the time for campaigning has ended. The time for governing has begun again. Sharing a smoke -- however unwise or un-PC that might sound -- or a drink or a meal every once in a while is just one way to jumpstart a relationship. In a democracy, government cannot be a warfare of interests. It depends on people in our government honoring principled disagreements but always keeping in mind that what unites us as Americans is more important than what divides us. The responsibility of leadership is to repair some of the broken trust in American institutions. That effort must extend beyond photo-op bipartisanship. It must be built on the foundation of honest conversation and getting to know each other as people rather than partisan caricatures with cloven hooves and horns. A cigarette summit isn't a one-step solution, it's just the start of a conversation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Monkeys taught how to gamble and play video games. People paid to watch grass grow. Swedish massages given to rabbits. Half of $1 million spent on a video game that is now helping terrorists train for missions. And $1 billion spent to destroy $16 billion worth of ammunition. These are just a few examples from the 100 entry-long list in a book detailing government waste, compiled by retiring GOP Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. In the 2014 edition of the \"Wastebook,\" Coburn notes that getting rid of the practice of pork barrel spending is next to impossible. \"What I have learned from these experiences is Washington will never change itself,\" he said. Massages for rabbits . Some of the worst offenses listed in the book: . -- The National Institutes of Health spent $387,000 to give Swedish massages to rabbits with a mechanical machine. Coburn notes that the NIH has a $30 billion annual budget and that the director of the NIH claims an Ebola vaccine would \"probably\" be ready now but for a lack of funding. -- NASA pays Russia $70 million per passenger to send American astronauts to the International Space Station and back. The space agency is spending $3 billion on the ISS this year and will conduct studies, many proposed by elementary students, including one on the \"design and creation of better golf clubs.\" -- \"Only someone with too much of someone else's money and not enough accountability for how it was being spent could come up with\" a $10,000 program paying people to watch grass grow. That grass -- saltmarsh cordgrass, which can grow to be 7 feet tall -- was being observed in New Smyrna Beach, Florida as part of a Fish and Wildlife Service program. The National Science Foundation is a favorite target in Coburn's book this year. The foundation spent $171,000 to teach monkeys how to play video games and gamble in order to \"unlock the secrets of free will,\" according to the report. Other examples include $5.2 million for \"voicemails from the future that warn of a post-apocalyptic world,\" $1.97 million for a Facebook page and P.R. for fossil enthusiasts and a $46,000 grant to support the annual Clean Snowmobile Challenge -- a contest to determine who can make the most environmentally friendly snowmobile. The National Science Foundation is also planning on spending $1.5 million to monitor Americans' attendance at science festivals. Another $200,000 will go to a study meant to determine \"why Wikipedia is sexist,\" according to the Wastebook report. The State Department spends $90 million a year on cultural exchange programs, including one such program which sought to dispel a Pakistani journalist's perception that Americans are \"fat, rude, and cold.\" It worked. The agencies could not immediately be reached for comment. Expensive destruction . \"The real shock and awe may have been the $1 billion price tag the Pentagon paid to destroy $16 billion worth of ammunition, enough to pay a full years' salary for over 54,000 Army privates,\" said Coburn. The book cites Pentagon officials who said the surplus ammunition has become \"obsolete, unusable, or their use is banned by international treaty.\" The book notes a 2014 Government Accountability Office investigation which concluded poor record keeping was the reason the military purchased so much ammunition it didn't need. The Army spent nearly half a million dollars -- $414,000 -- to develop a video game called \"America's Army, \" a version of which terrorists have used to train for missions, according to National Security Agency e-mails sent in 2007 and leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Department of Defense is spending $80 million on a real-life \"Iron Man\" suit. The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) would need 365 pounds worth of batteries to power the suit, according to the \"Wastebook.\" Congress ended this fiscal year with a debt under a trillion dollars for the first time since 2008, according to the Wastebook report, but Coburn notes that the deficit still added $486 billion, or half a trillion dollars, to the national debt, which is \"quickly approaching $18 trillion.\" Of the entries listed in his book, Coburn, who will retire in 2016 after serving two terms, asks, \"Is each of these a true national priority or could the money have been better spent on a more urgent need or not spent at all in order to reduce the burden of debt being left to be paid off by our children and grandchildren?\"",

Richmond captures the solitude and expanse of places like central Wyoming and Montana in his latest photography project, \"Last Best Hiding Place,\" which releases in book format in June in the United Kingdom and in the fall in the United States. But don't expect any romanticized, idyllic scenes in his photography. \"I preferred the idea of actually slowly looking at the places away from perhaps Western art,\" he explained. \"Looking at the the sort of everyday side of things, which I find more interesting.\" Richmond began the project seven years ago as the financial crisis began to unfold across the United States. He said he was surprised by \"the scale of development on halt in the towns outside Salt Lake City.\" He named his photography series \"Last Best Hiding Place\" after a phrase he came across during his travels, referring to those living \"slightly under the radar\" in remote parts of the American West. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"Some of the parts in ... central Wyoming and central Montana, they are as remote as I've ever been,\" Richmond said. \"And when you're traveling 50 miles between almost just a gas station and that's it, it sort of changes one's viewpoint of scale and distance.\" Richmond spent the early part of his career as a fashion photographer and taking portraits of actors including Ben Kingsley, Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson -- but his heart wasn't in it. \"I wasn't really thrilled by the idea of being a fashion photographer,\" Richmond said. \"After the death of my first wife, it just sort of taught me to do what you want to do, and I go 'OK I want to concentrate on this sort of work.'\" His images include people and places in faraway towns like Miles City, Montana; Deadwood, South Dakota; and Eureka, Utah. Often, Richmond would determine where he'd go next by pulling out a map and picking a town that had an interesting name. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. \"I remember looking in Utah one time and I came across this town -- I just thought, well it sounds really interesting and it's in the hills, and it's called Eureka,\" Richmond explained.  \"The story of the town itself is quite typical of a lot of those towns: it was nothing, no food, it grew huge and then slowly died off. \"(But) the thing that really fascinated me was the fact that this town was really hanging on ... everything just seemed to click in that town.\" Richmond spent one summer traveling with a group of rodeo cowboys, captured in one image simply doing their laundry.  He said the biggest culture shock of his entire trip happened during the rodeo events. \"I was surprised by ... the sense that at rodeos, you have the whole idea of prayers. It's such an un-English thing. At any sort of sports event (in England) you wouldn't have a quiet moment and say the Lord's Prayer and 'God bless the troops' ... but out there it seemed absolutely standard.\" Out of the thousands of images that he took, Richmond carefully selected ones he felt embody the real face of the American West. But he insists that his audience needs to \"create their own backstory\" about what they are witnessing in his photos. \"The place has to resonate with me ... there has to have some sort of lyricism or poetry about the image so people can see into it,\" he said. \"There's no story here so the pictures don't have to fit in ... these pictures  can float around a bit more, they don't have to fit with a strict text narrative.\" Tim Richmond is a fine art photographer and master printer.

Liu Xiaobo: The leading Chinese dissident was sentenced to 11 years in prison late in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power. He's the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. His sentencing prompted a groundswell of support for him from former Peace Prize laureates and perennial contenders. Vaclav Havel, the hero of Czechoslovakia's 1989 Velvet Revolution (who never won the Nobel Prize), retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who did, in 1984) and the Dalai Lama (1989) were among a group of intellectuals who publicly urged the Nobel Committee to give the prize to Liu shortly after he was sentenced. American writer Kwame Anthony Appiah, the head of the American PEN center, a literary and human rights organization, nominated Liu in January, he said.' The Wall Street Journal reported in February that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said it would be \"totally wrong\" for \"such a person\" to win the Nobel Peace Prize, and that the comment was later scrubbed from the official transcript of the briefing. The Irish bookmaking Paddy Power has already paid out on bets for him to win the prize, it announced Wednesday after a surge in betting led it to suspect that information had leaked. Memorial: Born of the violence and repression that accompanied the final days of the Soviet Union, the Russian human rights group now focuses on monitoring \"hot spots\" or conflict zones within the country -- a task that has proven deadly. The group's leading activist in Chechnya, Natalya Estimirova, was kidnapped and murdered in July 2009. She was shot in the head and the chest, and her body was dumped in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. Estimirova had worked in Chechnya for more than 10 years and had openly criticized Chechnya's Moscow-backed president, Ramzan Kadyrov, and his methods. Her murder outraged human rights activists worldwide. Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the European Union and the United States were among those appealing to Russia to conduct a transparent investigation of the crime. Mary Robinson: The first woman to be president of Ireland went on to be the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, a post she held from 1997 to 2002. After she left the United Nations, she founded a new organization, Realizing Rights, which aims \"to put human rights standards at the heart of global governance and policy-making and to ensure that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are addressed on the global stage.\" Robinson also is a member of the Elders, a group of leading statesmen and stateswomen brought together by former South African president Nelson Mandela -- himself a Nobel Laureate -- to support peace building and try to address the major causes of human suffering. The 13 current, former and honorary Elders include six Nobel Peace Prize winners. Robinson trained as a lawyer and has argued cases before the European Court of Human Rights, the European Court in Luxembourg, and Irish courts. Morgan Tsvangirai: The longtime leader of the opposition to Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe entered an uneasy power-sharing agreement with his rival in 2009, becoming prime minister. Tsvangirai has led the Movement for Democratic Change since 1999, surviving three assassination attempts, beatings and imprisonment. He rejects the charge that he \"sold out\" or gave legitimacy to Mugabe with the power-sharing agreement. \"The country was confronted with chaos and anarchy. We rescued our country and saved it in order to have the long-term stability that we are looking for,\" he told CNN last month. He continues to press for \"a credible and legitimate election\" in Zimbabwe, he said. Sima Samar: The chairperson of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, Samar is a medical doctor who fled Afghanistan when its communist regime arrested her husband in 1984. She remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women's affairs minister in Afghan President Hamid Karzai's transitional administration. She's done work on human rights around the world, not only in Afghanistan. She served as the United Nations special rapportuer for human rights in Sudan from 2005 to 2009, and was considered for the post of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, according to an organization which tries to predict Nobel Peace Prize winners. \"She has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from Islamist radicals, and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women,\" the Peace Research Institute Oslo said, adding that she \"does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process.\" PRIO is not connected to the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which chooses the winners. Its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, also considers the Democratic Voice of Burma news agency and the Special Court for Sierra Leone to be top contenders. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout, Robyn Curnow and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.",
        "summary": "(CNN) -- A week of Nobel Prize announcements comes to a climax on Friday with the unveiling of the winner of the Peace Prize, perhaps the world's most prestigious award. And the Norwegian Nobel Committee seems to like springing surprises. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said it would be \"totally wrong\" for \"such a person\" to win the Nobel Peace Prize, and that the comment was later scrubbed from the official transcript of the briefing.

        "article": "Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's face on the cover of the latest Rolling Stone sparked a backlash against the magazine in social media and in boardrooms around the country. \"THE BOMBER,\" the cover reads. \"How a popular, promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam and became a monster.\" The photo of a tousle-haired, thinly goateed Tsarnaev is one the suspect posted online himself and has been picked up by other outlets. A groundswell of criticism objecting to its placement on Rolling Stone's cover emerged Wednesday on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and among leaders in Boston, where the marathon bombings killed three people, wounded more than 200 and led to a frantic manhunt that left a police officer dead. But some people defended the magazine's decision, saying it draws attention to the story of a young man who seemed an unlikely terrorist. Ed Kelly, president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts, called it \"insulting.\" Using Tsarnaev's booking photo might have been one thing, but a photo that shows \"the innocence of youth\" gives the wrong message, Kelly told CNN. \"He gave up any innocence he had on April 15, when he took the life of an innocent child, two women and then went on to execute a police officer,\" Kelly said. \"What he did to a city, a country, we're never going to forgive him for it,\" Kelly said. \"We're not going to cower from it. It disturbs us that our media chooses to celebrate it.\" Three prominent New England-based businesses -- CVS pharmacies, Stop & Stop, and Tedeschi Food Shops -- heard the public outcry and announced they will not sell that edition, which will be on newsstands soon. Rolling Stone's most controversial covers . \"Music and terrorism don't mix!\" the Tedeschi firm said on its Facebook page, which carries the cover image with a circle and a line crossed through it. One Facebook commenter said, \"I'm done with Rolling Stone.\" The 7-Eleven corporation said Thursday its nearly 1,700 company stores across the country won't sell the issue, and the corporation is encouraging its 5,900 franchise stores to follow suit, according to 7-Eleven spokeswoman Margaret Chabris. She said the convenience story chain will likely resume carrying Rolling Stone after the issue with Tsarnaev on the cover but \"that hasn't been decided yet.\" The Illinois-based drugstore chain Walgreens and Rite Aid, based in Pennsylvania, said they won't carry the issue, either. And in a letter to Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino urged the magazine to follow up with stories \"on the brave and strong survivors\" of the attacks and the doctors, nurses, friends and volunteers who helped them. \"The survivors of the Boston attacks deserve Rolling Stone cover stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them,\" Menino wrote. Did missed connections in murder case open door to Boston bombings? Rolling Stone, critic defend cover . In a statement, the magazine said its thoughts were \"always with\" the bombing victims and their families. \"The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day,\" it said. \"The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers, makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens.\" Suspect pleads not guilty . While primarily a music magazine, the journal also has forged a reputation for hard-hitting pieces on national affairs, politics and popular culture. For example, journalist Michael Hastings wrote a 2010 profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal that led to the officer's abrupt retirement. In his profile, Hastings quoted McChrystal and his staff criticizing and mocking key administration officials. Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple said Rolling Stone should be out defending its article, because it's \"a pretty easy thing to defend.\" \"What you have here is a story about a guy who was very integrated and well-balanced, by all accounts, member of our society until something happened,\" Wemple said. \"We don't know precisely what happened and that was the whole point of this Rolling Stone story -- to account for how he slid off the rails.\" He called the companies that are pulling it from the racks \"cowardly,\" noting that The New York Times used the same photo back in May. The photo doesn't glamorize Tsarnaev, he argued, but \"humanizes\" him for people \"who want to see him as an animal from Day One.\" \"The facts are he wasn't an animal, at least to his peer group, for the longest time. They remember him as a dear friend,\" Wemple said. \"That's a problem, because he was part of our society and he turned on it by all indications, or allegedly.\" Share your view of the cover . The article about the bombing suspect is a deeply researched account, the magazine said in a synopsis about the story, which it published online Wednesday afternoon. Among its revelations: . -- A public plea from his former wrestling coach may ultimately have convinced Tsarnaev to surrender when police surrounded the boat in which he was hiding. -- In high school, Tsarnaev played down the fact that he was a Muslim. But he also took his religion seriously. -- He once confided to a friend that he thought the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks could be justified because of U.S. policies toward Muslim countries. Parents of suspect share phone call with son . Slammed across social media . But Rhode Island-based CVS Caremark Corp. said its decision \"is the right decision out of respect for the victims of the attack and their loved ones,\" company spokesman Michael DeAngelis told CNN. Tedeschi Food Shops, based in Rockland, Massachusetts, said it supports the need to provide news but not \"actions that serve to glorify the evil actions of anyone. With that being said, we will not be carrying this issue of Rolling Stone.\" Stop & Shop, a chain of stores based in Quincy, Massachusetts, said it won't carry the latest issue \"due to the public response and our customers feedback,\" spokeswoman Suzi Robinson said. Richard \"Dic\" Donohue, a transit police officer injured in a shootout with the bombing suspects, also criticized the cover. \"The new cover of Rolling Stone has garnered much attention due to its sensationalized depiction of one of the alleged bombers. My family and I were personally affected by these individuals' actions. I cannot and do not condone the cover of the magazine,\" which is thoughtless at best, he said. And the magazine's Facebook post of the cover image had received more than 16,000 comments by Wednesday evening. \"Oh look, Rolling Stone magazine is glamourizing terrorism. Awesome,\" Adrienne Graham commented on the magazine's Facebook page. \"I will NOT be buying this issue, or any future issues.\" Others expressed similar sentiments, and words such as \"tasteless,\" \"sickening\" and \"disgusting\" flew around social media. \"What a slap in the face to the great city of Boston and the Marathon Bombing victims,\" commented Lindsey Williamson. But on The New Yorker's website, a column by Ian Crouch speaks out against the rush to judgment and in favor of the magazine. The \"vitriol and closed-mindedness of the Web response to the Rolling Stone cover, before anyone had the chance to read the article itself, is an example of two of the ugly public outcomes of terrorism: hostility toward free expression, and to the collection and examination of factual evidence; and a kind of culture-wide self-censorship encouraged by tragedy, in which certain responses are deemed correct and anything else is dismissed as tasteless or out of bounds,\" he wrote. The cover image was not engineered, he wrote. \"What is so troubling about this image, and many of the others that have become available since April, is that Tsarnaev really does look like a rock star. In this way, the photograph on Rolling Stone is of a part with the often unexpected, and unsettling, portrait of Tsarnaev that has emerged over the past few months.\" S.E. Cupp, who will co-host CNN's new \"Crossfire\" program, tweeted, \"To me, seems @RollingStone isn't glamorizing terrorism, but proving that it can look innocent and young and attractive. Important lesson. \"I hope every young @RollingStone reader reads Tsarnaev story, realizes that radical Islam's here, can even infect a young Jim Morrison.\" Tsarnaev supporters respond . The cover also brought out comments from the \"Free Jahar\" movement. (Dzhokhar is also spelled Jahar or Djahar.) \"#BoycottRollingStone calling Djahar a monster and stirring the pot even more shame on you! Innocent until PROVEN guilty,\" tweeted @Jahars_Tsarnaev. Authorities accuse Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan of setting off a pair of bombs just seconds apart near the finish line of the packed Boston Marathon course on Boylston Street on April 15. Tamerlan was killed during the police pursuit three nights later; Dzhokhar was captured and charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack. He pleaded not guilty to the charges last week.

        "article": "Washington (CNN) -- When Sen. Mark Begich looks at the next two years, he says he is not concerned about the tough votes he is bound to have to make that could have an impact on his re-election in 2014. The moderate Democrat from Alaska even laughs a bit when he says, \"Every vote we take here is tough.\" \"My strategy has always been to do what I am going to do and focus on my issues,\" Begich said in an interview with CNN. Begich is one of six moderate Democrats from \"red\" states whose terms ends in two years. Max Baucus of Montana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas are among the 20 Democrats whose terms will be up in 2014; Republicans will defend 13 seats. CNN Election Center: Complete results . Though no Republican has declared a run against Begich, speculation in Alaska is that Gov. Sean Parnell will challenge the first-term senator. Since 2008, when the former Anchorage mayor narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Ted Stevens, Begich has voted as a moderate and has shown willingness to work with the other party. At times, he says, that can get lonely: \"You feel like a Lone Ranger sometimes.\" Asked about positions he has taken on oil and drilling or on transportation in the 112th Congress, Begich said, \"Sometimes I feel like I look around and I look behind me and there aren't many national Democrats there. But that is the way it goes.\" Though fiscal cliff and budget issues are likely to dominate Congress' lame duck session -- and likely the new Congress -- there are any number of issues that could emerge in President Barack Obama's second term that could test moderate Democrats. Much has been made of liberal Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin elected to the Senate last week and both parties being pulled away from the middle, but Begich points out that moderate Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana also were elected. 2014 battle for the Senate starts now . Senate votes will be heavily scrutinized in midterms . But Begich's optimism may not be well-founded -- the reality, says Nathan Gonzales from the Rothenberg Political Report, is that even the most benign votes Begich and his fellow moderates make will be used against them in 2014. \"Senators that are up for re-election are up under a larger microscope. Their votes will be dissected even more closely when they are in cycle,\" Gonzales said. Joe Manchin of West Virginia fired a warning shot -- literally -- to his fellow Democrats when the former governor was running against Republican businessman John Raese in the special election to fill the remainder of the late Sen. Robert Byrd's term. In a 30-second statewide TV ad, Manchin fired a bullet through a symbol of the House-passed cap-and-trade legislation -- a bill incredibly unpopular in his coal-rich state -- thereby both highlighting his opposition to the proposal and trumpeting his support of Second amendment rights. Democrats may also be emboldened by the way voters in some states last week supported Democrats in the Senate even while voting for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \"We learned from Tuesday's results that voters are willing to split their tickets,\" Gonzales said. In Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, all states in which Romney outran Obama by more than 10 points, Democrats won Senate seats. Though ill-chosen comments on rape by Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana helped the Democrats in each case, Landrieu's chief of staff, Jane Campbell, is encouraged. Though she did not guarantee victory -- \"I am not telling you that it is going to be easy. Her races have never been easy,\" Campbell said -- she did sound confident. Landrieu \"has run three times in a state that has always had a Republican lean, and her numbers have gone up every single time,\" Campbell said. Every election \"she has always been among the top targets and she has always shown the people of Louisiana and they have asked her to come back.\" Campbell noted the senator focuses on issues that her constituents care about, singling out protecting the state's bayous, holding BP oil company responsible for recovery from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, and education. New U.S. House: Women and minorities to the left; white men to the right . Focusing on issues important to constituents . Begich took the same tack -- listing issues like oil and natural gas, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and transportation -- as his selling points to Alaskan voters. Throughout the conversation he mentioned issues most Democrats wouldn't touch, like auditing the Federal Reserve, strengthening gun rights and lowering the corporate tax rate. Begich's strategy seems clear -- focus on issues that matter to Alaskans for the last two years of his term. \"I always run like I am 15 points behind. You always run hard,\" Begich said. \"I am focused in the last several years on the issues that matter to Alaska.\" But how does that jibe with the wider Democratic caucus? When the 113th Congress is commenced in January, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will have to unite his caucus. With a mixed bag of priorities, and a handful of more moderate members focusing on getting re-elected in 2014, that could prove taxing. \"Leader Reid has a difficult task and I think the president is going to be looking to define his legacy,\" Gonzalez said. \"I think he is going to try to get something big done that is going to have political consequences. The ones who have the most on the line are the people who will face voters in the midterm.\" Jim Manley, who used to work as the chief spokesman for Reid, said he expects that the majority leader is going to go out of his way to make sure every Democrat feels comfortable with each vote. \"There are different ways to juggle votes,\" Manley said. \"In the end, Reid understands that they have to do what they have to do to get re-elected. Reid understands that they need to do what they have to do to represent their constituents.\" After all, Manley pointed out, Reid has had to do this ever since becoming majority leader in 2006. \"He spent the last couple of years juggling the competing concerns of (moderates) Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson against the demands of (progressives) Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders.\" Begich says he assured Reid before the 2012 elections that he is ready to take hard votes and that the leader doesn't have to worry about putting him in a tough spot. Even so, said a confident Begich, he likes where he is two years out from the election. \"Some of the guys who were running for re-election (in 2012) had to moderate in my direction,\" Begich said. \"I came in with these positions already because that is who I am.\"",

While America's Curiosity rover has excelled at sending back pictures of rocks on the Martian surface, Europe has not been left behind - as these stunning images of the Martian landscape show. On 8 June, the high-resolution stereo camera on Mars Express captured a region within the 1800 km-wide and 5 km-deep Argyre basin, which was created by a gigantic impact in the planet\u2019s early history. It reveals the astonishing beauty of the red planet, with mountains frosted in carbon dioxide, and vast craters in an area researchers have dubbed the 'island of silver' due to the frost topped peaks. The Argyre and Hooke Craters on mars, with a frosting of carbon dioxide clearly visible in the top right of the image, taken from the Mars Express spacecraft. The area covered by the new images . After Hellas, the Argyre impact basin is the second largest on the Red Planet. The name stems from the Greek word \u2018argyros\u2019 (silver) and Argyre was . an \u2018island of silver\u2019 in Greek and Roman mythology. Giovanni . Schiaparelli, the famed Italian astronomer, gave the name to this bright . region on Mars in his detailed 1877 map. At the centre of the larger impact basin is a flat region known as Argyre Planitia. The . Mars Express images in this release all show a portion of the northern . part of this area, with a large portion of each image dominated by the . western half of the 138 km-wide Hooke Crater, named after the British . physicist and astronomer Robert Hooke. Most . of Argyre Planitia has been shaped by wind, glacial and lacustrine . (lake-based) processes, creating the smoother appearance of the . landscape surrounding Hooke Crater. Inside Hooke Crater itself, . researchers say prevailing wind activity has formed dunes and helped to create linear . erosion, clearly seen in the images. The most striking feature of this image release, shown clearly in . the first image at the top of the page, is the icing sugar-like covering . of the surface to the south (left) of the image. This is frost, but . made of carbon dioxide, not water. Carbon dioxide ice is commonly . seen on the surface of Mars, and has long been thought to form only at . ground level, freezing out of the atmosphere as frost, which is most . likely the case here. The lowlands to the south of Hooke and regions . within the crater are covered by a thin ice layer, the images show. However, it is . lacking on the inner north-facing crater wall. ESA scientists believe it was probably melted . there by the Sun, as indicated by the timing of the image. Taken at . around 4:30 in the local afternoon and during the southern hemisphere\u2019s . mid-winter, the Sun would have been just over 20 degrees above the . horizon. It should then have been able to melt ice on the steeper . north-facing slopes, but would probably not have had enough time to warm . and melt any on low-lying horizontal surfaces.

Men, Southerners and over-55s were found to despise the annual treasure hunt for Christmas necessities most. Bah humbug! In a survey on over 1,000 Americans, 32per cent agreed with the statement, 'I would rather have root canal treatment than be forced to go Christmas or Holiday shopping every day for weeks on end' GameIt's founder Bryce Johnson points out that 32per cent of the U.S. population equates to over 100million Americans who can't abide Christmas shopping. 'Personally, I\u2019d rather have my molars extracted without an anesthetic than have to go Holiday shopping every day,' he says. Apparently, geography plays a role. Thirty-six per cent of Southerners quizzed would opt for the root canal option, compared to 26per cent of North-Easterners.

        "article": "Lee Wallace is determined not to let 14 minutes of meltdown define an entire season at Rangers. As far as he is concerned, the fightback starts now. Wallace has listened to the flood of criticism that engulfed Ibrox in the wake of Monday night\u2019s 3-1 home defeat from Hibs, which contained that extraordinary sequence of first-half concessions. Manager Ally McCoist bore the brunt of the uproar, with his position being openly questioned in some quarters, but Wallace would prefer to look in the mirror and to those who sit beside him in the dressing-room. He doesn\u2019t hide from that fact that, bar maybe one game, the players simply haven\u2019t met the standards they should have reached in the Championship. Rangers defender Lee Wallace insists Rangers will not let the 3-1 defeat to Hibernian define their season . Hibernian's Jason Cummings scores his second goal of the night as they defeated Rangers 3-1 at Ibrox . Yet the 27-year-old left-back also has a sense that obituaries of their campaign are being written far too early. A six-point deficit has seen Rangers replaced by Hearts as favourites for the second-tier title by some bookmakers. The Ibrox club, according to that strand of opinion, are in danger of seeing their off-field woes being replicated on the pitch as their hopes drift away. Wallace logs such predictions away for future use. Expecting to see an instant response in Saturday\u2019s trip to Livingston, he remains steadfast in his belief that Rangers will find real form and ultimately achieve their goals. \u2018I definitely think it will come,\u2019 he said. \u2018I have a belief that we can do it. \u2018I\u2019ve got a feeling that we are being written off and the manager is being questioned. That goes with the territory but I believe that, with the boys we have here, we will be fine come the end of the season. \u2018We have to use the criticism positively. We know it happens and you are never going to get away from that. We are a bit more scrutinised here but we are ready for it and it\u2019s up to us to go out there and make it better.\u2019 The 27-year-old Wallace believes Rangers will 'use the criticism' from their loss to Hibernian 'positively' Ally McCoist (left) is under considerable pressure after another poor Rangers result . Wallace wasn\u2019t a chief culprit against Hibs but was still one component of a back four that simply disintegrated once the first goal was leaked. Rangers have defeated Premiership opposition this term and dismantled a decent Raith Rovers outfit on their own patch. Wallace is well aware, however, that league success is founded upon steady runs of results. And be believes that is primarily the responsibility of those who actually cross the white line. \u2018We have got to do a lot more as players. I look at the 11 or 12 games we\u2019ve played so far and, Raith aside and the Inverness result, there has been no consistency in our performances. We have to find that quickly or we are going to fall behind. We have to get started soon. \u2018The buck stops with us first and foremost. It\u2019s a collective thing between the players and management. Only a couple of times this season have we found that consistency we need and that\u2019s been the disappointing thing for me. \u2018We wanted to make a mark as early as we could. We wanted to be sitting top of the league and to be the team everybody is talking about. Wallace is fully behind manager Ally McCoist and says that the side will improve as the season progresses . Cummings (second left) celebrates with his team-mates after putting Hibs 0-3 up on Monday night . \u2018It\u2019s early in the season and that\u2019s the only positive thing. We have certainly got time and we, as players, have to start doing better on the pitch.\u2019 McCoist led the internal inquest this week but has also tried to rally spirits and galvanise the squad ahead of their return to action. Having also lost at home to Hearts, the margin of error available to Rangers has been significantly reduced. \u2018We\u2019ve looked at the stuff from the Hibs game on the video and the manager has gone into it in detail,\u2019 said Wallace. \u2018He wasn\u2019t happy and he was getting his message across. Now it\u2019s up to us to respond on the park. \u2018It was an open forum as we were watching the video. The players had things to say, as did the management. That\u2019s the best way - we can both reflect, look at how we can get better and move on. Anybody can speak up. \u2018At half time on Monday night a couple of the lads spoke up and at the end the dressing room was not a good place to be. Rangers boss Ally McCoist blasted his side's dismal defending after crashing to defeat . David Gray wheels away in celebration after heading home Hibs' second goal at Ibrox . \u2018The manager has got us focused on the next game now. We can\u2019t get too downbeat about it. It was disappointing in the aftermath. It\u2019s not a great feeling when you get beat at home but you need to quickly forget about that and don\u2019t go into the next game mumping and moaning with heads down. \u2018It\u2019s a big one for us at Livingston and the players are looking forward to it. We need to start building a bit of momentum.\u2019 The confidence currently coursing through Hearts was underlined when Kevin McHattie this week spoke about the possibility of an unbeaten league campaign. Wallace is admiring of the start made by his former club, under the command of Robbie Neilson, but cautions them against thinking too far ahead. \u2018Hearts are obviously going in the right direction,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018We wanted to hit the ground running because there were a lot of questions asked about playing against full-time opposition this season. \u2018We wanted to answer that quickly but I think in time we will grow into it, build a bit of momentum and we will get back to playing football in the Premiership.\u2019 Nicky Law celebrates scoring for Rangers, but it was only a consolation . Rangers fans made a swift exit from Ibrox at the full-time whistle of their match against Hibernian .",

        "article": "(CNN)They're a relatively small group of parents in a big country. But their decision not to vaccinate their children can have a profound impact on public health. Opponents of vaccines against diseases like measles are simply on the \"wrong side,\" CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta says. Just how many people are we talking about, and what do we know about them as a group? Here's a look at some key numbers. According to the CDC, in the United States: . \u2022 95% of children in kindergarten have had vaccines for preventable diseases, including two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. But that figure is not spread evenly across the country. \u2022 82% of children in Colorado have had the two-dose MMR vaccine that doctors say is necessary. In Mississippi, virtually all children in kindergarten (99.7%) are vaccinated. \u2022 26 states have not reported meeting a government target of 95% coverage for MMR. The differences stem from varying laws over when exemptions are allowed. The National Conference of State Legislatures reports: . \u2022 48 states and the District of Columbia allow religious exemptions from vaccines . \u2022 20 states allow philosophical exemptions. Even within states that have high exemption rates, \"vaccination exemptions have been shown to cluster geographically, so vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks can still occur where unvaccinated persons cluster in schools and communities,\" the CDC says. Because of health complications, some children should not be vaccinated, doctors say. These children are also one of the biggest reasons vaccination is so important. Those unvaccinated can carry the disease and infect vulnerable children. Families with medical exemptions make up a small portion of those who don't vaccinate. The CDC reports: . \u2022 In California, there were about 1,000 medical exemptions in the 2013-2014 school year, and more than 17,000 philosophical exemptions. \u2022 Florida had less than 800 medical exemptions and about 4,000 religious exemptions. Florida does not allow philosophical exemptions. \u2022 Mississippi and West Virginia do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions, and they reported only about 50 medical exemptions combined. (See a full state-by-state breakdown here.) Why do some parents opt out?  They're more likely to have vaccine safety concerns and to \"perceive fewer benefits associated with vaccines,\" a study found -- despite the scientific evidence and debunking of a study that suggested vaccines could trigger autism. Most of these parents do believe vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children. But many also believe their children could suffer from the vaccines themselves. The study was published by Public Health Reports, the official journal of the U.S. Public Health Service, in 2011. It found that among parents who delay and refuse vaccines: . \u2022 70% say they believe the vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children (compared with 96% of parents who vaccinate) \u2022 63% say they fear their children could have serious side effects (compared with 31% of parents who vaccinate). \u2022 57% say they have concerns about autism. \u2022 78% say they believe children get too many shots. \u2022 There's also more mistrust of the medical community among those who don't vaccinate. While 95% of parents who vaccinate said medical professionals in charge of vaccinations have their children's best interest at heart, 77% of parents who delayed and refused vaccines agreed. The Public Health Reports study also found that families of unvaccinated kids are more likely to be: . \u2022 Wealthier on average, with annual incomes more than four times the poverty level . \u2022 Non-Hispanic white . \u2022 Married couples in English-speaking households . \u2022 Educated, with college degrees, and . \u2022 Covered by private health insurance. In the medical community, conversations are underway about how to reach out to these parents. \"There's not much we can do about the small core of people who oppose vaccines based on ideology,\" Ford Vox, a brain injury doctor in Atlanta, wrote in a CNN column. \"... But we have a better shot with the larger and more rational border zone of the vaccine hesitant who may base their concerns on genuine cases of vaccine harm, such as the very small but accepted link between influenza vaccination and a temporary paralysis called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome.\" Cultivating \"a strong patient-doctor relationship is the most successful method of reversing vaccine opposition,\" he wrote. That means carving out a system in which \"your doctor is granted the time to truly understand you, while at the same time allowing your doctor to treat you appropriately. ... If we've done our job right, you'll seek out the insights we've earned from treating many challenging cases over many years. And we'll know we've succeeded in our new relationship when you let us vaccinate your children.\" What is your message to those who don't vaccinate?",

        "article": "By . Rachel Quigley . and Daily Mail Reporter . Sleeping pills: Last week Kerry Kennedy blamed a July 11 car accident on a seizure but now blood tests show she was on the sleeping pill, Ambien . Kerry Kennedy pleaded not guilty in court tonight and blamed Friday\u2019s car accident, where she careered into a truck and was later found slumped over the wheel, on a seizure. Speaking outside court, JFK's daughter claimed numerous neurological tests show that she suffered a 'partial seizure' which was the result of a previous head injury. 'I want to apologise to the driver of the truck who I apparently hit and all those who I apparently endangered,\u2019 she told reporters outside North Castle court in Amonk, New York, this evening. The 52-year-old twice repeated that no drugs or alcohol were found in her system after the crash. On Friday, the ex-wife of Governor Cuomo, was . found by police slumped over her wheel of her 2008 silver-white Lexus RX . 350 at one of the exits of the highway and charged with driving while . ability impaired by drugs. Surrounded by relatives this evening, Kennedy also detailed how she underwent an MRI and 'a comprehensive battery of neurological tests' at Mount Sinai medical center after the crash. \u2018A MRI showed an area of hypo-density which appears to be the result of a head injury sustained some time ago,' she said. Kennedy concluded that doctors believe the accident was caused by a partial seizure. She added that this was the only seizure she had ever suffered and would continue to get treatment over 'the months ahead and, perhaps, indefinitely.' Recalling Friday's accident she said, 'I remember getting onto the highway and then I have no memory until I was at a traffic light and a police officer was at my car door.' 'I have never had any history of drug or alcohol abuse and in my discussion with the police officer I was confused and erratic,' she continued. She told the officers that she had possibly mixed up two prescription drugs before getting behind the wheel and taken the sleeping pill Ambien instead of a daily prescription that she takes for a thyroid problem. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Kerry Kennedy, centre, is flanked by her sister Rory, left and brother Chris right, as she arrived at court on July 17. The Kennedy family have been accused of behaving like an 'organised crime' clan following her arrest . Remorse: Kennedy apologised to the truck driver and everyone else she 'apparently endangered'. She finished her speech by asking for privacy and thanking her supporters and family . Heartbroken: Ms Kennedy speaking before the funeral of her best friend and sister-in-law, Mary Richardson Kennedy, in Bedford, New York in May . The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy . crashed into on Friday spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's . daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the . Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered . off the interstate. He told . the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really . drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody. 'I\u2019ve been a truck driver for 22 years. I\u2019m pretty sure she was half-asleep or very, very intoxicated. 'She scared the heck out of a lot of people. She was completely out of it.' He told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off again, all while veering in and out of lanes. 'She started . coming at me, like she didn\u2019t see me. She was starting to nod off, . her head was bobbing toward the steering wheel,' he said. 'I hit the horn. I couldn\u2019t go back into . the breakdown lane because there was a disabled truck up ahead. I could . either hit that truck or let her do whatever she was going to do. 'I hit the brakes, but she hit the brakes at the same time and veered right into me. 'When she hit me, my left tire tore up . her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot \u2014 not the way you\u2019d wake up if you\u2019d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.' Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York . One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said. Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really . drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled . out of bed. Kennedy gave blood and urine samples at a nearby police barracks, which she said Tuesday evening showed that she had no alcohol or drugs in her system. On Sunday, one of Kennedy's family claimed she had had a seizure behind the wheel, which caused her to crash. Friday's collision came just two months . after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after . struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse. Political marriage: Ms Kennedy is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left . Family: Kerry with her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and his (now deceased) wife Mary at a gala event in 2006 . Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig . about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged . her car and left it with a flat tire. Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway. They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers. Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests \u2013 all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system. Ambien: Ms Kennedy said she was 'confused and erratic' when she told officers she may have taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'. But on Wednesday she said her 'first instinct' appears to be right after tests showed it WAS in her system the day of the crash . The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions. However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas. Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy. Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002 . Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign. She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010. The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage. Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated. Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'. Watch video here .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Cindy Goodman was having dinner with a group of girlfriends one night when the conversation took a surprising turn. Summer at the beach may seem like fun, but more Americans are afraid to take time off. Goodman asked her friends where they planned to go this year for their summer vacation. Nowhere, they answered. They were afraid to take time off because they didn't want to risk losing their jobs, she says. \"It's going to be an interesting summer,\" says Goodman, a Miami Herald business columnist. \"The people who still have a job are really feeling overwhelmed and overworked. They're afraid to take vacations, but at the same time, they need them more than ever.\" The bad economy isn't just depleting bank accounts. It's cutting into people's vacation time. Americans typically take time off and kick back during the summer. This year may be different. People are worried that a temporary vacation could lead to permanent time off, Goodman says. \"I don't think anyone is going to be fired for taking two weeks off, but they might think that they'll think of another way of doing my job without me,\" says Goodman, who wrote about people's vacation fears for her blog at http://worklifebalancingact.blogspot.com. How to take time off without guilt . Americans had a difficult time taking vacations even before the economy slumped. Numerous articles and studies draw the same conclusions: Americans don't know how to pry themselves away from the workplace. This year, Expedia.com, the travel reservation company, conducted a survey that compared Americans' vacation habits with their counterparts in other countries. The survey said about 34 percent of Americans don't take all the vacation time they earn each year. In contrast, 22 percent of French citizens and 24 percent of Germans don't take all the vacation allotted to them. Japanese workers are the least interested in using all of their vacation days, according to the Expedia survey. About 92 percent of Japanese workers do not take all of their vacation days. Christine Louise Hohlbaum, author of \"The Power of Slow: 101 Ways to Save Time in Our 24/7 World,\" says even when Americans manage to take vacations, they still don't completely leave their office, because of technology. \"You can take a BlackBerry on vacation and still have a conversation with clients anywhere else in the world,\" Hohlbaum says. \"It's wonderful for innovation, but not so great for leisure.\" But workers who don't take vacation hurt themselves and their companies, Hohlbaum says. Overworked employees get sick more often and place themselves at risk for long-term illnesses such as heart disease. Companies suffer because their employees are too tired or ill to be productive, she said. Workplaces are full of exhausted employees who have already checked out in their cubicles, Hohlbaum says. \"If people are overworked, they're surfing the Internet,\" she says. \"They're not contributing to the bottom line.\" Hohlbaum says she talked to a computer technician who found a way to take more time off but be more productive. He started a walking group for his colleagues during lunch hour. He and his colleagues were transformed. \"It was an amazing experience,\" Hohlbaum says. \"They bonded. It helped people relax and when they got back to work, they were much more productive.\" She suggests that other workers follow his example. Explain the upside of the idea to the boss: The company benefits from well-rested workers because they're more productive. Set performance goals with your boss to prove taking time off will allow you to thrive and will result in greater productivity, she says. Some workers, however, find that their biggest skeptic may be internal; they don't know how to take it easy anymore, Hohlbaum says. \"If you're so used to being purposeful, make leisure time your purpose,\" Hohlbaum says. Alternative ideas . Goodman, the Miami Herald columnist, offers some of her own tips for taking time off. If you're too afraid to ask for an extended vacation, plan four-day weekends or time off around holidays. Goodman says she's going to take a four-day vacation around the Fourth of July. But there was a time when she traditionally took two-week vacations during the summer. \"I have the same kind of fear that everyone else has, '' Goodman says. \"I want to take time off, but I don't want to miss too much work time. I want to keep my column in the paper every week.\"",

A Frenchman who lived in a Paris apartment which was the size of a toilet for 15 years, is suing his former landlord for \u20ac25,000, it has been revealed. The 50-year-old tenant, known only as Dominique, will appear in court on Tuesday to pursue the owner of his former flat for rent reimbursements and damages after he discovered the property was let to him illegally. Under French law, an apartment must have at least 9 square metres of living space to be put up for rent. Illegal: Under French law, a property must have at least nine square metres of liveable space but Dominique's flat had just 1.56 metres of habitable room (stock picture) But Dominique's flat on the 11th floor of a block in the French capital had just 1.56 square metres of liveable room. By the end of his tenancy in Janary this year he was paying \u20ac330 a month in rent, which works out as \u20ac211 per month per liveable square metre. The only furniture or appliances Dominique could fit into the hovel was a mattress, sink and humble hob for cooking. Speaking to French publication 20 Minutes, Dominique's lawyer Aurelie Geoffroy confirmed the legal action would be going ahead. Mr Geoffroy said: 'The money entails rent repayment from the last five years, as well as moral harm suffered by my client. The tenant\u2019s case was championed by French housing charity the Fondation Abb\u00e9 Pierre. They are campaigning\u00a0 to highlight the number of tiny apartments being illegally let to desperate tenants in Paris. In demand: Living space is so sought after in Paris, above, that tiny rooms are being let illegally for huge rent . Samuel Mouchard from the charity, said: 'When I first saw the apartment, I asked myself \"how is this possible\" 'Until then the smallest flat I\u2019d ever seen was three square metres, but Dominique broke that sad record' Speaking after the initial discovery of Dominique's situation in January, Mouchard said: 'Some landlords are unscrupulous. The law is there but it needs to be enforced. 'Tenants need to know that it\u2019s forbidden. If they have doubts they can go to their local Town Hall where measures can be taken to protect them or to rehouse them.'",

The 45-year-old skipper, who has been  named as James Noble from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, was airlifted to hospital by RAF helicopters yesterday but later died. Two other men - aged 32 and 38 - are still missing after the Ocean Way vessel ran into problems off the Northumberland Coast, but the search operation has now been called off. The two survivors, men aged 38 and 28-years-old, were taken to Wansbeck Hospital in Northumberland suffering from hypothermia and have been released following treatment. Apart from Mr Noble, the four crew members are said to be Filipino, according to reports. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said nothing had been found in the search for the remaining men. A statement said two helicopters and merchant vessels had been searching throughout Sunday afternoon and evening but were unable to find any sign of the two missing crewmen. 'The search will not resume,' said the statement. A search and rescue operation was launched for the missing skipper and crew of the fishing trawler Ocean Way after it began transmitting a mayday signal early on Sunday afternoon. In total three people were rescued from the water, including the captain, Mr Noble. An RAF rescue helicopter was dispatched to the scene while a Norwegian chopper was also sent to help with the search. The Humber Coastguard said the vessel, based at Fraserburgh, was last heard from about 100 miles east of the Farne Islands. The boat, which had sailed from Tynemouth, began transmitting an emergency beacon and attempts were made to contact the skipper. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said: 'We are greatly saddened by this tragic news and our heartfelt thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of the crew at this very difficult time. 'This terrible accident highlights the very real dangers our fishermen face on a constant basis and is a sober reminder of the important role fishing plays in putting food on our plates.' Scotland's Fisheries Minister Richard Lochhead said: 'I am very sorry to hear about the loss of the Fraserburgh registered fishing vessel the Ocean Way that has tragically resulted in fatalities. 'This is a terrible tragedy and my thoughts are with the loved ones and friends of the crew. The trawler,\u00a0based at Fraserburgh, was last heard from about 100 miles east of the Farne Islands . Three people were winched from the sea - two have survived and another two are still missing. The search has now been called off . 'This tragedy will be felt by all fishing communities and is a horrible reminder of the dangers our fishermen face day in day out to bring fish to our tables with many paying the ultimate sacrifice. 'I would like to pay tribute to all the personnel involved in the rescue operation.' A spokesman for the MCA said yesterday that none of the rescued sailors were wearing lifejackets. She said the whereabouts of the boat was unknown and refused to be drawn on speculation it had sunk until the outcome of further investigations. The Coastguard have been broadcasting mayday relay messages requesting all passing shipping to look out for the missing crew. It is believed the boat set sail from North Shields on Saturday and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating the incident. The Ocean Way had reportedly sailed out of Tynemouth with four Filipino crew and a British skipper. File photo .

In a nod to the \"it's complicated\" sexual identities of many of its users, the social network on Thursday added a third \"custom\" gender option for people's profiles.

A New York police officer who allegedly plotted to kidnap up to 100 women before raping, killing, cooking and eating them has been charged. Gilberto Valle, a married six-year veteran of the department who lives in a middle-class Queens neighborhood, even allegedly used  law enforcement databases to conduct surveillance on up to 100 potential victims before keeping scores of files on them listing their personal information. The 28-year-old, who works in Harlem, has been arrested by the FBI for the heinous plans after his estranged wife reportedly tipped off police. Valle was arraigned Thursday afternoon and was held without bail on charges including kidnapping conspiracy and unauthorized use of law enforcement records. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Scroll down for video . Not guilty: Gilberto Valle, 28, is seen in this courtroom sketch with his public defender Julia Gatto, center, when he pleaded not guilty to criminal charges Thursday afternoon . 'Sick plans': Gilberto Valle has been arrested for allegedly detailing his plans to kidnap, torture, kill, cook and eat women. His list of potential victims allegedly named more than 100 women . One document on Valle's computer was . titled 'Abducting and Cooking (Victim 1): A Blueprint,' according to the . criminal complaint. The file also had the woman's birth date and other . personal information and a list of 'materials needed' - a car, . chloroform and rope. 'I was thinking of tying her body . onto some kind of apparatus ... cook her over low heat, keep her alive . as long as possible,' Valle allegedly wrote in one exchange in July, the . complaint says. Emails, computer files, and fetish . chats were retrieved from the NYPD officer\u2019s computer. None of the women . was harmed, although a prosecutor said some of the women knew Valle and . he had stalked at least two of them at home or work - once in his . police car in a 'very intimidating fashion.' In other online conversations, . investigators alleged, Valle talked about the mechanics of fitting the . woman's body into an oven, noting that the women\u2019s legs would have to be . bent, and discussed how 'tasty' one woman looked. 'Her days are numbered,' he wrote, . according to the complaint. That woman told the FBI she knew Valle and . met him for lunch in July. Harrowing: He allegedly discussed how to kill a woman by slowly cooking her over emails with co-conspirators . Shock: Valle's brother arrived at the apartment to collect his dog and was swarmed by reporters . Public defender Julia Gatto had asked for bail, saying the Valle was only guilty of a 'deviant fantasy.' 'There's no actual crossing the line from fantasy to reality,' Gatto . said. 'At worst this is someone who has sexual fantasies about people he . knows and he talks about it on the Internet,' according to the AP. But Valle was arrested because he was . too close to carrying out the 'grotesque and disturbing' plots, . Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said. He had 'plans to kidnap, . rape, torture, kill and eat the body parts of young women, some of whom . the FBI has identified and they acknowledge knowing the defendant for a . period of time,' she said. Valle, a graduate of the University . of Maryland, where he studied psychology and criminal justice, was . suspended from the police force after his arrest. He allegedly created files on his personal computer containing at least 100 women with at least one photo of each, details of their physical characteristics and lists of their addresses. He even allegedly had a file named 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A Blueprint' containing information including the woman's name, date of birth, height, weight and bra size. FBI agents tracked down 10 of his named victims who said they knew him. Phone records showed he was once outside the home of one woman, who told investigators that she hardly knew him. In another eerie message, Valle, who is believed to have married in June, wrote that his knowing the victims would lead to a 'flawless' abduction as his arrival 'will not alert her', the complaint noted. Scene: FBI searched his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens (pictured) and allegedly found lists of women on his home computer. One file was named: 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A Blueprint' His co-conspirator, who has not been named, responded with equal excitement at the plans. 'I love that she is asleep right now not have the slightest clue of what we have planned,' Valle allegedly wrote, ABC reported. 'Her days are numbered... She does look tasty, doesn't she?' His alleged co-conspirator responded: 'You do know if we don't waste any of her, there is nearly 75 lbs of food there.' He also allegedly asked Valle, 'How big is your oven?' and 'What's your favorite cut of meat?' Their . bizarre relationship only became more deranged as Valle allegedly . offered to sell a woman to the other plotter in February for $5,000 so . that he could rape and kill her. But Valle said he would only deliver the . woman and would not get involved in the rape as 'I don't want to be . tempted the next time I abduct a girl', he wrote, prosecutors said. Vile: This photo shows a passage of a Federal complaint filed in New York on Thursday against Valle . Horrifying: The complaint shows Valle's in-depth plans for the kidnapping and killings of the potential victims . He allegedly added that the co-conspirator needed to ensure her body was not found.

It is believed he has a young child; his estranged wife has commented on Facebook about needing a babysitter, while the New York Daily News noted that his home appeared to be child-proofed.

        "article": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama said Tuesday it is disappointing that Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ignored warnings from Senate Democrats about appointing a successor to his Senate seat. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, right, names Roland Burris to fill President-elect Barack Obama's Senate seat. On Tuesday, Blagojevich, a Democrat, named former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris to serve the last two years of Obama's Senate term. Senate Democratic leaders have said they will block the appointment and are urging the governor to step down after his arrest on corruption charges -- a move Obama endorsed. \"Roland Burris is a good man and a fine public servant, but the Senate Democrats made it clear weeks ago that they cannot accept an appointment made by a governor who is accused of selling this very Senate seat,\" Obama said in a statement. \"I agree with their decision, and it is extremely disappointing that Gov. Blagojevich has chosen to ignore it.\" FBI agents arrested Blagojevich on December 9 after federal prosecutors alleged, among other things, that he had tried to sell Obama's former Senate seat. Blagojevich denies wrongdoing and has ignored calls to resign.  Watch Blagojevich appoint Burris \u00bb . Obama added that the best resolution would be for Blagojevich to resign office and \"allow a lawful and appropriate process of succession to take place.\" Burris, 71, also a Democrat, served Illinois from 1979 to 1992, first as state comptroller and later as attorney general. Earlier in December, he said that despite the scandal associated with the seat, he wanted the job.  Read more about Burris' personal and political life \u00bb . He also appeared to support Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan's efforts to remove Blagojevich from office, calling his alleged actions \"reprehensible.\" \"I certainly applaud her actions,\" he said of Madigan in a December 13 press conference, according to WBBM. \"Illinois is too important to its 18 million citizens to have a chief executive who is now incapacitated. \"The evidence that's been presented is pretty appalling, should that come out to be the case of what our governor is attempting to do,\" he said, according to WBBM. After Blagojevich's announcement, Burris asked to be judged on his own merits. \"I have nothing to do with the governor's problems,\" he told CNN. \"I am not tainted by this appointment.\"  Watch Burris defend himself on CNN's \"No Bias, No Bull\" \u00bb . Asked whether he thinks Blagojevich should resign, Burris said he has \"no opinion on the governor's problems.\" In a statement released Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, urged Blagojevich to not make this appointment. \"The governor must put the interests of the people of Illinois and all Americans first by stepping aside now and letting his successor appoint someone who we will seat,\" Reid said. Also, Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White said Tuesday that Burris' appointment will not be certified by his office. But Blagojevich said at a news conference Tuesday that he is confident the U.S. Senate will seat his appointment and asked the media not to visit any of his political troubles on Burris.  Watch Anderson Cooper and his panel discuss the appointment \u00bb . \"This is about Roland Burris, not about the man who appoints him,\" he said after announcing his choice. \"Please don't let the allegations against me taint this good and honest man.\" Burris does not have to be formally approved by the Senate. But if there is a question about the appointment, the Senate could reject the appointment and immediately vacate the seat, or vote to seat the senator pending an investigation by the Rules Committee or another body, associate Senate Historian Don Ritchie said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, who appeared at the afternoon news conference, warned senators about blocking Burris from being seated. \"There are no African-Americans in the U.S. Senate. And I don't think any U.S. senator who's sitting in the Senate right now wants to go on record to deny one African-American from being seated in the U.S. Senate,\" he said. \"I would ask you to not hang or lynch the appointee as you try to castigate the appointer and separate the appointee from the appointer,\" Rush said.\"  Watch Rush comment on the appointment \u00bb . Rush said he will take that argument to the Congressional Black Caucus as well as U.S. senators -- including Dick Durbin, a Democrat and Illinois' senior senator. Burris downplayed the importance of race in his appointment. \"I think that certainly is not a major issue,\" Burris said regarding race. \"Why those persons will not seat me is a question that they're going to have to answer, because I have done no wrong.\" Many in the Senate maintained that concerns over the appointment had nothing to do with race or Burris' qualifications. \"The problem is the appointer, not the appointee,\" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, said Tuesday. \"The governor in this act of defiance is doing more harm than good.\" Burris, a principal at Burris & Lebed Consulting in Chicago, would serve the remaining two years of Obama's Senate term. Burris previously ran and lost bids for the U.S. Senate and governor, losing the gubernatorial nomination once to Blagojevich. Also Tuesday, Burris responded to questions about Blagojevich's legal troubles.  Watch Burris accept the Senate appointment \u00bb . \"I have no comment on what the governor's circumstance is,\" he said. \"As a former attorney general of the state, I know ... that in this legal process, you're innocent until you're proven guilty.\" Despite the pressure for him to step aside, Blagojevich said he was required by law to fill the Senate seat. \"The people of Illinois are entitled to have two United States senators represent them in Washington, D.C. As governor, I am required to make this appointment. If I don't make this appointment, then the people of Illinois will be deprived of their appropriate voice and vote in the United States Senate,\" he said. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said \"no comment\" when asked for reaction to the Burris announcement. Although Blagojevich, 52, has not commented publicly on the charges, his lawyer Ed Genson said the governor has done nothing wrong and does not intend to step down. It is the sole authority of the Illinois governor to name a successor to serve the remaining two years of Obama's term. CNN's Ed Hornick contributed to this report.",

        "article": "By BELINDA BROWN FOR THE DAILY MAIL . Why is the success of female emancipation and equal opportunity \u2014 both cornerstones of the modern feminist movement \u2014 measured by the number of women who are in top jobs such as directors of FTSE 100 companies or High Court judges? The depressing answer is that the so-called feminist agenda has been hijacked by one group of women who have turned it into a self-improvement manifesto for their own social type: the well-educated, professional and political elite of high-flying woman. Recently, Professor Alison Wolf, an economist at King\u2019s College London, argued that feminism has become obsessed with these ambitious over-achievers and is ignoring the concerns of the majority of women \u2014 those who didn\u2019t go to university, those who are stay-at-home mums and those in low-paid jobs. Scroll down for video . The so-called feminist agenda has been hijacked by  the well-educated, professional and political elite of high-flying woman . While Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has predictably criticised Baroness Wolf, I couldn\u2019t agree with her more. This privileged middle-class sisterhood \u2014 who have enough money to farm out their childcare to a small army of nannies, au pairs and nursery school teachers \u2014 judge themselves by the success of their working lives. Sadly, they judge all other women, too, by the same unreasonable yardstick. In doing so, they patronisingly ignore millions of other women, many of whom would prefer to stay at home and raise a family \u2014 at least until their children start full-time education. The fact is that many of those women who choose to work treat their often low-grade, poorly-paid job principally as a financial means of supporting their family, rather than as an end in itself. In short, whereas there is a powerful feminist elite who live to work, the vast majority of women work \u2014 if they have to, for economic reasons \u2014 simply as a means to live. The tragedy is that, in their blinkered attitude, modern feminists are causing deep damage to the latter for not espousing their values. Thanks to their high public profiles and influential positions, they are able to dictate how the success of female emancipation and equal opportunity should be measured. To watch the video in full please click here . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman (pictured) has criticised\u00a0Baroness Wolf for her comments on feminism . And, of course, they measure it as they measure their own success \u2014 strictly in terms of work. As a result, the policies of governments of all political parties over recent years have been dominated by the principle of getting all women into work or back into work. This, in my view, is utterly misguided. For the unforeseen consequence is that Britain is now one of the most family-unfriendly countries in the developed world \u2014 with a distorted tax and benefit system to match. Astonishingly, given how often David Cameron talks about the importance of marriage and the family, he continues to head a government that has a particular bias against single-earner households and which seems to be driven by the belief that even mothers with young children should go out to work as much as possible. This emphasis on working-women perfectly suits those well-educated, professional, middle-class couples in which both husband and wife work. Their double incomes allow them to buy a big house, good schools for their children, more exotic holidays and, crucially, round-the-clock childcare. But for governments to adhere to such a distorted mindset does not help the millions of women who do not feel defined by their job \u2014 but who care passionately about keeping their relationships and families together. By ignoring the wishes of this large group of women, the blinkered feminists \u2014 unable to conceive of a world where not all women think like them \u2014 make the tough lives of so many mothers even tougher. What these feminists seem to have forgotten is that not all women are the same. Admittedly, some women will always strive to succeed at the highest level \u2014 and it is absolutely right that they have the equal opportunity to do so. But there are millions of women who, for all sorts of reasons \u2014 relating to their life-priorities, wealth and education or social background \u2014 have no interest in pursuing a career. They simply want to have happy, healthy children; a supportive, loving husband, and enough money to get by. The problem is, however, that as a result of the pressure from modern feminists and their influence on people such as Mr Cameron (whose high-flying wife once earned an estimated \u00a3400,000 salary as creative director of an upmarket stationery firm), women with more modest, family-oriented ambitions suffer. Prime Minister, David Cameron (pictured), often talks about the importance of marriage and the family while he continues to head a government that has a particular bias against single-earner households . At the top end of the social ladder, successful working women are invariably supported by an equally well-remunerated husband. But at the other end of the social scale, life is very different. Encouraged by government incentives to go out to work (for example, given childcare vouchers) \u2014 and, of course, through economic necessity \u2014 they feel they have to take a job . . . even if they don\u2019t want to. Every morning I see women leave the council estate where I live, to go to work \u2014 stopping with a heavy heart at the nursery or child-minder to drop off a young child. This is the routine of millions of women all over the country. The term feminism, first used in Britain in the 1890s, comes from the French word \u2018feminisme,\u2019 coined by utopian socialist Charles Fourier. There is another side-effect. The increase in the number of women at the lower end of the social scale who feel they have to go out to work inevitably means a reduction of the numbers of men in the workplace. Indeed, all the official statistics show that male unemployment is on the rise. As a result, working women \u2014 if they have a partner \u2014 often return home from work to find an unemployed partner who\u2019s been kicking his heels at home all day, seething with resentment and low self-esteem. Not surprisingly, she, in turn, will often seethe \u2014 in despair at the lack of gratitude. This can easily lead to a downward spiral, with couples much more likely to break up. Then, sadly, the great risk is that this will damage the couple\u2019s children, with boys, in particular, suffering at school, experimenting with drugs or drifting into crime. And so, in the next generation, male unemployment is the almost inevitable outcome. And all this is because of the power of a feminist elite who have relentlessly promoted social policies that sacrifice the values and interests of ordinary and relatively happy family lives in the name of \u2018equal opportunity\u2019. The damage, I fear, they are doing to conventional family life in this country is enormous. So what can be done to reverse this? Professor Alison Wolf (pictured) argued that feminism has become obsessed with these ambitious over-achievers and is ignoring the concerns of the majority of women . Of course, nobody wishes to stop any talented and ambitious woman from achieving at the highest level and it\u2019s absolutely right that such women compete with men on a truly level playing field. But there needs to be an acknowledgement that a woman\u2019s worth cannot be judged solely by the job she does, and that a woman who stays at home to bring up a family is every bit as valuable as other more professionally ambitious women. What\u2019s needed is a major sea-change in thinking, one that acknowledges that men and women are not the same \u2014 but also that all women are not the same, either. I\u2019m not saying that those who choose to stay at home should be offered unfair financial inducements to do so \u2014 but they should certainly not be punished for doing so. Yet that\u2019s exactly what the current tax and benefits system does. This is perverse. Why, for example, shouldn\u2019t a stay-at-home mother be able to transfer her . personal income tax allowance to her husband and partner, thereby reducing the tax burden on hard-pressed family finances. But that should only be a first step. Since the feminist revolution began in the Seventies, billions of pounds must have been spent on promoting sexual equality and women\u2019s role in the workplace. The great irony is that its success has resulted, today, with the Government worried about levels of male unemployment. For the incontrovertible fact is that men are suffering: falling behind women in education; in the numbers taking up apprenticeships and, increasingly, in the workplace, too. This isn\u2019t a development for feminists to crow over; it\u2019s a potential social disaster. It is a truism that men in work are happier men, and they make better husbands and more attentive fathers. I believe that if more men could be helped to find jobs, while more women choose to stay at home, society would benefit with a virtuous circle of happier husbands, happier wives and, of course, happier children. But that can only happen if the Government \u2014 and the feminist elite it seems to be in thrall to \u2014 accept that a woman who stays at home and raises children can be every bit as valuable to society as a whole as the woman who goes out to forge a brilliant career.",
        "summary": "Why is the success of female emancipation and equal opportunity \u2014 both cornerstones of the modern feminist movement \u2014 measured by the number of women who are in top jobs such as directors of FTSE 100 companies or High Court judges? Sadly, they judge all other women, too, by the same unreasonable yardstick. The tragedy is that, in their blinkered attitude, modern feminists are causing deep damage to the latter for not espousing their values. By ignoring the wishes of this large group of women, the blinkered feminists \u2014 unable to conceive of a world where not all women think like them \u2014 make the tough lives of so many mothers even tougher. What these feminists seem to have forgotten is that not all women are the same. Prime Minister, David Cameron (pictured), often talks about the importance of marriage and the family while he continues to head a government that has a particular bias against single-earner households . At the top end of the social ladder, successful working women are invariably supported by an equally well-remunerated husband. But at the other end of the social scale, life is very different. And all this is because of the power of a feminist elite who have relentlessly promoted social policies that sacrifice the values and interests of ordinary and relatively happy family lives in the name of \u2018equal opportunity\u2019. I\u2019m not saying that those who choose to stay at home should be offered unfair financial inducements to do so \u2014 but they should certainly not be punished for doing so. This isn\u2019t a development for feminists to crow over; it\u2019s a potential social disaster."

        "article": "(CNN) -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration own about 250,000 foreclosed properties awaiting resale. Hundreds of thousands of additional units will likely be taken over by the government and become available in the next few years. At least another 250,000 foreclosed properties are awaiting sale in the private market. This drag on the housing market is one of the reasons why housing prices continue to fall and new housing construction is stalled. All these properties could provide families with housing instead of sitting empty (and, in some cases, looking the part). To increase the use of idle government properties and recover some of the massive losses on mortgages, the Obama administration is looking mainly for proposals from firms or nonprofit organizations to buy and rent out the vacant properties. The Department of Housing and Urban Development gets a gold star for this new strategy, but pursuing another approach at the same time \u2014 helping more families become homeowners \u2014 would take us further still toward ending the housing crisis. Both approaches would reduce rents: As more renters buy vacant homes, demand for rentals will ease, and renting out vacant units will increase the supply of rental housing. Both approaches are also likely to jack up demand for idle or underemployed construction workers, who'd be needed to repair and renovate the properties. Right now, millions of families are paying more in rent than the monthly carrying costs of owning a comparable property. In 2009, 3 million families with children and annual household incomes below $30,000 were paying more than $800 per month in rent, according to the 2009 American Community Survey. If they can pay that much, they could certainly afford homes costing at least $115,000 \u2014 well above the value of homes at the 25th percentile of the price curve. With better access to financing, they could take advantage of bargain prices on foreclosed or other properties, and homeownership would immediately cut renters' housing costs and lock in great rates. Some past efforts at promoting homeownership failed when bad mortgages supported housing costs far higher than monthly rents on the expectation of home price appreciation. But that doesn't mean we can't learn from past mistakes or take advantage of the current market context to make a major dent in family housing costs by using idle housing and human resources. As we spell out in our book, \"Moving Working Families Forward,\" the government could create 1 million homeownership vouchers to cover the carrying costs of homes up to the 25th percentile of area home prices. Given today's low-home prices, such a plan would cost no more than about $3 billion per year and could be at least partially financed by phasing out the more costly and supply-oriented Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which offers a reduction in tax liability to property owners and private investors who develop low-income housing \u2014 and is a corporate honey pot that yields high profits and relatively few units for low-income families. A second approach would use turnkey programs. Firms and nonprofit organizations would purchase homes, qualify the buyers through credit counseling and credit repair, ready buyers for homeownership, make modest renovations and repairs, and sell the properties. With this option, like the homeowner voucher, government could lay claim to a modest share of any capital gain (say 15%-20%) when the property is resold. Among others, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Group of Cleveland is already trying the turnkey approach. Starting with unused housing from the Cuyahoga County land bank, the company hired local construction workers and trained the unemployed to spiff up the units, helped renters correct and raise their credit scores enough to qualify for low interest mortgages and down payment assistance, helped them get financing, and walked the families through the sale. Some renters took classes offered in financial literacy, too. On average, the renters reduced their monthly housing expenditures by a minimum of 25%, including taxes and insurance. As the project scales up to involve scores of properties, it will create new jobs and training opportunities for underutilized construction workers. Scaling up either homeownership initiative would be a move in the right direction, and either approach would help millions of middle income and near-poor families limit their housing costs. Finally, targeting demand policies toward housing can cost-effectively reinvigorate the broader economic recovery because of the close links between construction, manufacturing, and other industries. Just as important, by taking depressed units out of the housing market, the outlook for future housing prices will improve. This will reduce future foreclosures as more homeowners will make their payments rather than walking away from their mortgage commitments. It might even be enough to invigorate new housing construction. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Lerman and Robert Cherry.",

        "article": "Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen insists he wants to stay at White Hart Lane this summer, regardless of who the club appoints as manager. The Spurs centre back has been linked with a host of clubs following Tottenham's failure to qualify for the Champions League, with reports claiming the Belgian international would ask to leave the club had Tim Sherwood been retained as manager. Despite claiming he would wait for a new manager to be appointed before deciding his future, it now appears Vertonghen is keen to remain in north London. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Vertonghen take part in charades for Red Nose Day . Staying put: Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen insists he is happy at White Hart Lane and wants to stay . 'I\u2019ve got a couple more years at Tottenham and I\u2019m happy, and I want to stay there, so it doesn\u2019t matter who the manager will be,' Vertonghen told Sky Sports. There is a chance the former Ajax man may be reunited with old boss Frank De Boer, who he played under at the Amsterdam Arena and remains one of the favourites to take the Tottenham hotseat along with Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino. Asked about the possibility of playing under the former Dutch international once again, Vertonghen said: 'He (de Boer) is a good manager but there are other good managers as well so, again, the chairman will make a good decision.' However, with the World Cup set to commence in three weeks time, Vertonghen is keen to do well for his country rather than see the tournament as an opportunity to impress fellow suitors on the global stage. 'I don\u2019t think that is one for us because we all play for nice teams already and we just want to do something nice for Belgium, not for ourselves.'

        "article": "By . Sean Poulter . Home buyers will be paying an average of \u00a37,500 in stamp duty within two years if the current house price surge continues, it is claimed. The recent property price boom has delivered a huge windfall for the Treasury and the Chancellor George Osborne in terms of income from the controversial property tax. Research suggests that the failure to raise the thresholds at which stamp duty applies in line with rising prices means the Government made an extra \u00a34.7billion from home buyers in 2012-13 alone. Home buyers will be paying an average of \u00a37,500 in stamp duty within two years it is believed . It seems the Government is keen to keep picking the pockets of buyers with no plans to revise the tax on buying a home, despite claims the current system is warping the market. The struggle to find the money to pay stamp duty is putting a huge burden on home buyers, who are facing other big bills, such as raising a deposit, funding legal and removal costs. Research by estate agents Haart (correct) suggests the UK average house price will rise above \u00a3250,000 by the end of 2016, which is the threshold for stamp duty to rise from one per cent to three per cent. Currently, a house selling for \u00a3250,000 attracts stamp duty at one per cent, which works out at \u00a32,500, however this rises to \u00a37,500 once the price hits \u00a3250,001. Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for \u00a360,000 or more. The recent property price boom has delivered a huge windfall for the Treasury and Chancellor George Osborne in terms of income from property tax . Now it is charged at one per cent on properties between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3250,000, three per cent up to \u00a3500,000, four per cent at \u00a3500,000-\u00a31,000,000, five per cent at \u00a31,000,001-\u00a32,000,000, and seven per cent above \u00a32,000,001. The Institute of Economic Affairs slammed stamp duty as \u2018a bad tax\u2019 which should be \u2018abolished\u2019 by the Chancellor, or \u2018at the very least\u2019 overhauled. Both the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Council of Mortgage Lenders think the crude thresholds should be replaced with a system similar to the income tax regime. The Haart chief executive, Paul Smith, said: \u2018If national property prices continue to increase at their current rate, the average price of a UK home will fall within the three per cent stamp duty tax bracket before the end of 2016 \u2013 which means buyers forking out at least \u00a37,500 on top of other costs when moving home. \u2018Where a property tips over into this 3% tax band, an extra penalty of at least \u00a35,000 is incurred on any property priced over \u00a3250,001. \u2018Stamp duty bands have not moved upwards in line with house price inflation, a fact that successive Governments have benefited from to the tune of \u00a34.7 billion for 2012/2013. \u2018First-time buyers, who pay an average \u00a3154,645, have no relief as they are already in the one per cent stamp duty band.\u2019 A second survey published by the Rightmove property website today (mon) raises the predicted price rise for 2014 to eight per cent. Rightmove estimates house prices will continue to rise despite measures introduced by the Bank of England last month to curb prices such as new caps on high loan-to-income value loans and stronger affordability \u2018stress tests\u2019 for borrowers. Earlier this week the Office for National Statistics said house prices in London had risen at a record annual rate of 20.1per cent while they were up 10.5per cent across the UK. Rightmove said the Government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme had not only encouraged first-time buyers, but had freed up the market for richer third-time buyers who could afford larger properties. Director at the group, Miles Shipside, said: \u2018The unleashing of this more affluent group, plus good supporting acts from first-time and second-time buyers, will mean that the musical chairs of trading up and down will continue in the second half of the year having been kick-started by Help to Buy in the first half.\u2019 The group also said that speeding up of housing completions, down 10 days year-on-year to 65 days had brought more sellers into the market. The housing website also added that the London ripple effect, which pushes up the prices of properties around the capital, continued unabated because of the shortage of suitable housing stock. The firm added it was seeing the beginnings of the same London ripple effect around large northern cities such as Manchester, Leeds, York and Liverpool. A third study published by the Post Office suggests the average cost of moving one rung up the property ladders is more than \u00a3100,000.

        "article": "By . Gemma Mullin . A stretch of Wales\u2019 highest mountain Mount Snowdon has been put on the market for \u00a37million after a sheep farmer decided to sell up. Dafydd Morris from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, has decided to give someone else the opportunity to own a 600-acre slice of the picturesque landscape on the northern slopes of the mountain. The 76-year-old, who still farms the land, bought the area in 1986 and says if it sells he will use the money to buy another farm lower down the mountain after facing difficulties in hill-farming. Clogwyn Du'r Arddu (pictured) is part of the area for sale and is known as one of the top spots for rock climbing . He told MailOnline: \u2018The reason we are selling is because it has become very difficult to farm, especially in the past two years. \u2018People were saying they were worried about the environment and they weren\u2019t happy about the way the land was being farmed. \u2018So I was thinking of giving them the chance by allowing them to buy the acres.\u2019 Mr Morris said he will not be selling the land to another farmer as he will remain farming on his remaining 600-acres. \u2018It will go to someone who wants to look after the environment. \u2018People can come there with their children and bring their tents. Schools will be able to come up and see a different area of the mountain.\u2019 Mr Morris, 76, said he is selling as the area has become difficult to farm, particularly in the last two years . The area for sale includes one of Britain\u2019s top rock climbing spots, Clogwyn Du\u2019r Arddu, and a 112-acre space called Cwm Arddu, which is on the market for \u00a32.5million. Remaining land will be sold off acre-by-acre at a cost of \u00a312,000. But Mr Morris, the former chairman of the independent Council of the Welsh Highland Shepherds, says he doesn\u2019t mind if there are no takers, as he will carry on as he had done. \u2018We just want to give those people that want to take care of the environment the chance to do so and so they can understand what it has been like for hill-farmers. \u2018If we make enough money we will buy a farm lower down the mountain but we will also keep our current one.\u2019 John Harold, the director of the Snowdonia Society, told the Independent that he hoped the proposal is \u2018motivated by a desire to protect the \u201ciconic landscape, precious mountain habitats, rare wildlife, and the \u201cmountain experience'\u201d rather than the \u201cpotential income of \u00a37.5million\u201d.\u2019 The 600-acre area on sale is in the national park (shown on map in relation to north Wales) He added: \u2018Fortunately, much of the land is a National Nature Reserve and nearly all of it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. It is unlikely Snowdon will end up spattered with private glamping sites or such eyesores.\u2019 Agents acting for Mr Morris have created an invite-only website to market the land to limit the number of potential buyers. It describes the land as \u2018one of the wonders of Wales\u2019 and \u2018one of the most visited tourist attractions in the UK\u2019. The advertisement states: \u2018A large part of the Snowdon massif is up for sale and Dafydd Morris is calling on all conservationists and the public in general to grasp the opportunity to buy a part of Snowdon to help conserve and cultivate its natural beauty for generations to come. \u2018Snowdon or Yr Wyddfa in Welsh is the highest mountain in Wales and is the home to a number of rare plant and bird species including the world renowned Snowdon Lily artic-alpine plant, treasured by the Welsh nation.\u2019 Ownership of Snowdon is shared between the National Trust, the national park authority and a private trust.",

        "article": "A couple caught having an office romp by a bar full of drinkers are both in serious relationships and failed to show up for work on Tuesday, it has emerged. The sexual antics of a man and a young woman at insurance firm Marsh Ltd in Christchurch were caught on camera last Friday night after pub patrons across the road noticed the amorous couple had left the lights on. But it has since emerged the man - a senior employee at the firm - is married and the woman, in her 20s, had become recently engaged, the New Zealand Herald reports. Scroll down for video . The young couple get to know each other in the Marsh Ltd offices in Christchurch . Marsh Ltd told the NZ Herald that neither employee was at work on Tuesday. The company is conducting an investigation and the woman has deleted her Facebook account. It comes after the romp caught the eye of revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery across the street, who then posted images on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. The incident provoked a huge reaction with one witness saying that because it went on for 'a good half hour', patrons in the bar 'started to get bored and drift off back to the dance floor'. \u2018The entire bar united in cheering them on,\u2019 said one person on social network Reddit. \u2018It started with a casual flirt. Then the kiss, grabbing the attention of all. Get it, son! Finally they moved to the back of them room, thinking they were unseen. Off comes the tights, down goes his head. By this stage, 50 bar patrons were pressed up against the window yelling their approval. \u2018To be honest, after watching them f*** for a good half hour, people started to get bored and drift off back to the dancefloor.\u2019 The couple had gone into the office after it had closed thinking they'd get some privacy when they were actually being watched by patrons across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery . Before long the pair start to undress in the office unaware that they were being watched . The couple even enjoyed a glass of wine as they enjoyed their own private party . Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show . However, it got so steamy at one stage that the band even stopped playing in the bar. But when calm was restored the cheeky musicians started up again with Kings of Leon song, Sex on Fire. 'The band had to delay playing because the customers felt the need to support this view. Props to them for their next song being Sex on Fire,' one Reddit user said. Rabobank\u2019s branding was also in many pictures on social media, only because it had naming rights to the building. Not that they escaped ridicule either. \u2018Congrats to the man who made a deposit at Rabobank this evening,\u2019 one Twitter follower posted. One Reddit user said: 'I guess it's not a bank for money.' While another also quipped on Reddit: 'When he withdrew he lost interest!' Twitter user Nick can't help making a quip about the couple and their antics . It got so steamy that the band even stop playing in\u00a0the Carlton Bar and Eatery as the action continued . The Privacy Commissioner John Edwards told Radio New Zealand that there was little the sexy pair could do legally following some local backlash against those who filmed the incident in the bar. Several commentators in New Zealand claimed that the couple's privacy had been breached, but Mr Edwards said it was unlikely the police could take action if a complaint was made. \u2018The people who were watching, we may criticise them for a lapse of decency in taking advantage of that, but it is unlikely there'd be any legal liability for their action,\u2019 he said. Privacy lawyer Kathryn Dalziel also told Radio New Zealand even though the couple did not give their consent for the images to be taken, they would have to show their privacy had been breached to make a successful case under the Crimes Act. Revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery posted images on Facebook and Twitter of the couple . Marsh Ltd said on Tuesday they still had not made any decision on whether the couple would get the sack or face any disciplinary action. \u2018We are not giving any further comment other than what has already been provided. We\u2019re dealing with the matter internally that\u2019s all we can say,'\u00a0a spokeswoman for Marsh Ltd told Daily Mail Australia. 'It\u2019s unknown what will happen to those involved at this stage, and what final decision will be made by the firm.\u2019",

        "article": "A Missouri mom who claims her son was 'kidnapped' by social workers in a hospital on the grounds of medical child abuse is desperately fighting to regain custody. Michelle Rider says her son Isaiah - now 16 - has had health issues since he was child, beginning with breaking his leg at age six and the bones never fully recovering. At 15 his leg was partially amputated to fit a prosthetic, however there were complications, with the teen suffering tremors and intense pain after the surgery. After being transferred to numerous children's hospitals around the country, an MRI determined Isaiah had tumors on his leg and he was diagnosed with neurofibromitoisis. Fighting for her son: Michelle Rider says her sickly son, Isaiah, was wrongly taken away from her amid allegations of medical child abuse . Isaiah under surgery at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago on March 31, but the tremors and pain persisted. Doctors suggested Isaiah manage without drugs. 'They couldn't help him, and I, as his parent, requested, \u2018Please, get him help somewhere,' Rider told The Blaze. 'I wanted him transferred,' Rider said . Rider said she called an ethics meeting with her son\u2019s doctors and social workers, asking that he be transferred to another hospital. Then on April 15, upon arriving at the hospital, Rider was met in the lobby by a social worker, who took her to a room with two doctors and another social worker, none of whom Rider had met before. The mom was then told Isaiah had been taken into emergency custody due to evidence of medical abuse. Doctors believed that Isaiah was coping better and improving when his mother was not around and that 'only pharmacological means can be used to treat pain', according to The Chicago Tribune. 'All attempts to \u2026 have [the] mother voluntarily partner with us in [the boy's] care have been futile and met with resistance,' the doctor's reported. 'In order to best develop a therapeutic medical plan for [the boy], we need to remove the mother from his care at the moment.' Poorly: Isaiah Rider has been in and out of hospital since the age of six, stemming from a broken leg that never properly healed . Stunned: Both mother and son said they did not understand what was happening when Isaiah was put into a foster home in Illinois . Isaiah was placed with a foster family in Illinois and Rider said she was left in complete shock. 'They literally did a hospital kidnapping,' she said. Isaiah has said he feels the same way as his mother and disagrees with what the doctors are saying. 'They kept telling me that .... my anxiety is my mom causing me pain. 'There were times [though] where I'd be in pain for hours at a time and they wouldn't give me anything. 'I needed, like, a muscle relaxer and they wouldn't give me anything for it. Told me to wait it through. 'That's immoral to me, when patient in pain needs medicine, give him some pain medicine. 'I was hurting so much at one point my nose bled. 'If I was a doctor, I'd be ashamed if I heard of other doctors doing stuff like this. They've been lying in the court.' Patient: Isaiah Rider and his mom Michelle have traveled to hospitals all over the country trying to find him the proper care . At the next custody hearing on August 11, Rider and her attorney, Randy Kretchmar, plan to challenge the case using an old federal law, which they believe has been violated. The Indian Child Welfare Act was passed in 1978 'protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families'. The law puts a greater emphasis on the proof to take temporary custody of Indian children. Kretchmar believes in this case there is no medical evidence that Rider had personally - physically or otherwise - wronged her son in any way. He also said that Isaiah fits the legal definition of an Indian child. Kretchmar said he understands that people will think that there is more to this story, but maintains there isn't. 'The system is something that needs to be radically confronted and resisted and changed and abolished,' he told The Blaze. Homesick: Isaiah said he longs to return home to his and family and friends in Missouri . 'It\u2019s very, very similarly minded people, a class of people who believe that they understand what\u2019s better for other people\u2019s children. 'They wouldn\u2019t come out and say that, but that\u2019s what they do. 'They make their living from acting that way.' Missouri state Rep. Ken Wilson told TheBlaze he was stunned when he heard of Isaiah\u2019s situation . 'These parents are hurting. What happened to them just should not happen to anyone else,'\u00a0 Wilson said. 'Who can possibly believe that child is better off in a foster home in Chicago than in the family home? 'That's another one of those bizarre things that you just have to think, \u2018'really?''.'",
        "summary": "A Missouri mom who claims her son was 'kidnapped' by social workers in a hospital on the grounds of medical child abuse is desperately fighting to regain custody. At 15 his leg was partially amputated to fit a prosthetic, however there were complications, with the teen suffering tremors and intense pain after the surgery. They couldn't help him, and I, as his parent, requested, \u2018Please, get him help somewhere,' Rider told The Blaze. ' Stunned: Both mother and son said they did not understand what was happening when Isaiah was put into a foster home in Illinois . Isaiah has said he feels the same way as his mother and disagrees with what the doctors are saying. ' The law puts a greater emphasis on the proof to take temporary custody of Indian children.

        "article": "When Luke Cameron decided to do a good deed every day for a year, he could never have anticipated how much it would change his life. The 26-year-old from Cheltenham made the decision after a close family friend died from cancer in 2013. He started writing a Good Deed blog and logged every kind gesture he made on the site, which has now amassed thousands of followers. Scroll down for video . Luke Cameron (left) started his daily good deed challenge last January\u00a0in memory of family friend Maura (right), who passed away in October 2013 . The kind actions range from taking out the rubbish for his elderly neighbour, to baking lemon drizzle cakes and sending them round to his friends and family. He has also bought countless meals for strangers at places like McDonald's and even paid for a person's petrol just because they were stood next to him in the queue at the station tills. In total, Luke estimates that he has spent \u00a33,000 in the last 12 months on good deeds, despite the fact that he was only earning the wage of a part-time shop worker. He said: 'In a world of taking selfies with your \"besties\" and Instagramming pictures of your new handbag and Rolex watch, we forget to think about anyone else but ourselves. 'Our generation has forgotten to care about others, because we are too self-obsessed  to even care what others are going through.' In total, Luke estimates that he has spent \u00a33,000 in the last 12 months on good deeds, including buying meals for strangers that he meets in restaurants . But while many people have been inspired by Luke's blog, he has also been on the receiving end of  sceptical responses. Luke said: 'The majority of people love it. I have my haters, but that's a given really. I try not to dwell too much on other people's opinions. 'Most people to begin with didn't understand why I was doing what I was doing and became very reserved about me helping them. 'Scepticism was rife among my monetary good deeds and some people questioned my motives and others thought I wanted something in return.' Luke decided to do a year of good deeds after a good family friend passed away in October 2013. He said: 'Maura was like a mother to me. She was hands-down the most incredible and inspirational woman I will ever meet. 'When a neighbour needed food, she gave her last potato. When a friend needed money, she gave her last pound. 'She gave her whole life selflessly helping others around her and at her funeral over 4,000 people queued for 3 hours to get in and pay their respects.' Luke now keeps a sweet bucket on his desk, for people to grab a quick snack. He also spent an evening putting kind messages on colleagues' desks . Luke used his love of baking in a good deed - he made lemon drizzle cakes and set them to friends and family. He also bought a bunch of flowers for a friend who had received some bad luck . Last December, Luke decided that January 1 would be the day that he\u00a0kick-started\u00a0365 daily good deeds. He began with some small\u00a0gestures\u00a0- on New Year's Day he said 'Happy New Year' to a woman serving his coffee in a Tesco cafe. On the second day, he bought food and drink for a couple of homeless people in his local town centre. A few days later, he handed over some spare change to a lady who didn't have enough coins at the parking meter. Since starting his challenge, Luke also entered\u00a0a competition run by Utility Aid to win the job of\u00a0National Philanthropy Manager, a.k.a The Nicest Job In Britain. His Good Deed challenge convinced the organisers that he was the right man for the job and so, for the whole of 2015, Luke will be paid to travel the UK and assist 45 different charities. Since starting his challenge, Luke also entered a competition run by Utility Aid to win the job of National Philanthropy Manager, aka The Nicest Job In Britain . Luke doing one of his good deeds - he realised a customer in his shop had left their mobility scooter in the rain, so brought it inside and wiped it down . He has also decided to extend his challenge for another year and claims the experiment has completely changed his life. He said: 'I think I have healed myself by helping others. 'It really changes your perspective on life when you help people. You become so much more grateful for what you have. 'I did this purely to help people as a social experiment. I wanted to see how helping others for a year can really help yourself. 'I've gone from working part time in a shop to now the national philanthropy manager where I am making my life's work about helping others and I've raised thousands for charity.' Luke also created Cards For Kindness - a pack of cards with good deeds that include: 'Tell your mum you love her,' and 'Tell a stranger they look beautiful.' The cards cost \u00a35 for a deck and 25 per cent of each sale goes to the British Heart Foundation. Good Deed 345: . One of my colleagues is on crutches after snapping his Achilles Heel. So today I grabbed his lunch for him and took it to his desk so he didn't have to hobble around getting it. Good Deed 341: . I baked a load of mini lemon drizzle cakes today and sent them around to friends and family. Good deed 258: . A small but helpful deed today. Carried down my elderly neighbour's trash. Bin day tomorrow. Good Deed 256: . I was with a colleague today, explaining about doing good deeds. She was a little skeptical about the whole thing, so while she was away from her desk, I left the money for her lunch. Maybe I can change her opinion of random kindness. Good Deed 244: . Today I helped somebody in need. I stopped my car on the way home as there were a couple with a map. I gave them directions to the centre of town. They were very grateful . Good deed 242: . While walking the dog, I noticed a load of litter over the field at 7am - clearly the morning after the night before. It was a few glass bottles and shredded cans. So I carefully picked them up and disposed of them. Good Deed 221: . I got up at 5.30am to help a friend move house today. I hired a van yesterday and drove around two hours to Exeter to load up and remove everything from a 3 bedroom house.",

Mitt Romney today stands on the brink of becoming the Republican candidate to challenge Barack Obama for the presidency of the U.S. But it could have been so different for the former Mormon missionary when he was almost killed in a car accident in Bernos-Beaulac, France, in 1968. The 21-year-old was driving from Pau to Bordeaux when he was hit by a car driven by a Catholic priest, which killed one of his own passengers. Wreckage: Former Mormon missionary Mitt Romney almost died in a car accident in Bernos-Beaulac, France, in 1968, which killed one of his passengers. The Citroen DS driven by Mr Romney is pictured . \u2018We were all talking about how dangerous how the highways were and the French highways,\u2019 Mr Romney said, reported the Boston Globe in 2007. \u2018Literally as we were having that conversation, boom, we were hit. It happened so quickly (that) there was no braking and no honking.\u2019 Mr Romney drove Mormon French mission president Duane Anderson and others to Pau, where a small Mormon congregation was in dispute. There were six people in total going back to Bordeaux when the car was hit and Mr Anderson's wife Leola was killed, reported the Boston Globe. Recovering in hospital: The 21-year-old Mitt Romney, pictured, was driving from Pau to Bordeaux when he hit a car driven by Catholic priest Albert Marie . Mr Romney, who has always insisted he was not at fault, was seriously injured and even feared dead for a moment after the crash. 'It happened so quickly (that) there was no braking and no honking' Mitt Romney . A policeman who first responded wrote \u2018Il est mort\u2019, or \u2018he is dead\u2019, in Mr Romney\u2019s passport. But at hospital he came out of a coma. He was left with a swollen face and fractured arm. Mr Anderson, who died in 1995, suffered injuries to his chest, ribs, lung, liver and spleen. The incident happened on a curving two-lane road on which Mr Romney passed another accident just before his crash, reported the Boston Globe. Injured: Mr Romney had been driving Mormon French mission president Duane Anderson, pictured, to Pau, where a small Mormon congregation was in dispute . Witnesses did claim Catholic priest Albert Marie, 46, of Sireuil, France, was drunk when the crash happened but this was never verified. 'I was frightened of driving a car (and) had a sense of vulnerability that I had not experienced before' Mitt Romney . Mr Marie was driving with his mother Marie-Antoinette Marie and a woman named Marguerite Longu\u00e9, 48, reported the Boston Globe. Mr Anderson never sued after the accident as he was worried about a religious run-in with the French government or the Catholic Church. Local police don\u2019t have any records of the accident because their documents are destroyed after ten years, reported the Boston Globe. Nowadays: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, centre, and his wife Ann, right, are seen after winning the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday . The other passengers in Mr Romney\u2019s car were French Mormon couple Suzanne and Bertin Farel and staffer David Wood, 21, of Salt Lake City. Mr Romney, Mrs Farel and Mr Wood, who now teaches in Natchitoches, Louisiana, are the only three people still alive from his vehicle. \u2018I was frightened of driving a car (and) had a sense of vulnerability that I had not experienced before,\u2019 Mr Romney said, reported the Boston Globe.",

        "article": "They had been meticulously planning their costumes for quite some time. The annual summer sports day had a long tradition of fancy dress and, eager to impress, the pupils of Sacred Heart Catholic School kept their outfits under wraps for weeks. They wanted to surprise their parents and teachers as they made their entrance at the school in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. And surprise them they did. With a flourish and a fanfare, they revealed their costumes - to outraged gasps from the crowd. Bad taste: A girl strides into her school at Chiang Mai dressed as Adolf Hitler, seemingly oblivious to the offensiveness of her costume . Shock: Smiling pupils carrying a Swastika flag were met with horror from foreign parents and teachers, who were left reeling at the bad taste of the procession . The smiling pupils arrived at the . school dressed in full Nazi regalia and carrying large Swastika flags, . leaving foreign parents and teachers open-mouthed. Leading the march into the sports . ground was a girl dressed as Adolf Hitler - complete with toothbrush . moustache - seemingly unaware of the offence . she had caused. She was followed by a procession of pupils dressed as SS guards - brandishing plastic machine guns. Stunned ex-pats were appalled. Surely the pupils were aware of what the Swastika and Nazis represented? Under fire: Thailand's education system was criticised as it emerged that not even the teachers knew what Swastika and Nazi costumes represented . Apparently not, as it emerged that not even the Thai teachers at the school understood what all the fuss was about. A . teacher at the school said: 'It was . all very embarrassing. Traditionally the students wear fancy dress on . the summer sports day and they like to keep everything they are . preparing quiet. Nobody saw any swastikas around the school before the . event. 'But then on sports . day when we saw these Nazi storm troopers we were appalled. We told the . Thai teachers that this was not on. But they did not understand what was . wrong with the display.' History lesson: The school was asked to put the Holocaust - and Adolf Hitler - on the curriculum . Today, a delegation from the . consulates of Britain, the United States, France and Germany descended . on the school to protest about the controversy - and called on teachers . to put modern history and the Holocaust on the curriculum. They left the premises after the school told them no malice had been intended. Chiang Mai is a popular retirement destination for many Europeans and Americans, some of whom lost relatives to the Nazis. A . British parent added: 'It could have been worse. They could have been . marching to the 'Horst Wessel Song or Bomb Oh Bombs on England.\" The . school's principals did not want to comment about the incident, but a . spokesman said: 'We did not know what the students had planned.

Kanya Khemanan, a director of the Thewphaingarm School, was forced to apologise to the Los Angeles-based Holocaust museum Simon Wiesenthal Centre following the incident. Rabbi . Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center said at the time: 'We are long . past the time when such incidents take place in Asia that can be excused . due to \"alleged\" ignorance of the Nazis' atrocities during World War .

The 48-year-old actor, who has played mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV series for 30 years, insists he is innocent of the allegations \u2013 which include child rape \u2013 and has vowed to \u2018fight the charges vigorously\u2019. However, the show\u2019s bosses said he would not be appearing in any further episodes while legal proceedings are under way. Le Vell, pictured with his wife Janette Beverley, who he split with last year . The actor was first arrested under his . real name, Michael Turner, in September 2011 and questioned after a . teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her from the age of six. Three months later, however, . prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take the allegations . to court and no charges were brought. At the time the father of two said he was \u2018delighted\u2019 to have been \u2018completely exonerated\u2019. He thanked police for their \u2018thorough . investigation\u2019, and expressed his gratitude to fans and the Coronation . Street cast for their loyal support during \u2018a most difficult and . upsetting phase in my life\u2019. He returned to the show after a short break and is currently involved in some of its main storylines. Stalwart: Michael Le Vell, real name Michael Turner, has been in the ITV soap since 1983 and is one of the country's biggest soap stars, and like his character, it has emerged how much he enjoys a drink . However, on Thursday evening it was . announced that after a review of the evidence, Le Vell had been charged . with 19 sex offences, including raping a child, indecently assaulting a . child and sexual activity with a child. There was no sign of the actor . yesterday at the \u00a3325,000, two-bed terraced house he has been renting in . Hale, Greater Manchester, since separating from his wife\u00a0 Janette . Beverley and leaving the family home in 2011. But in a\u00a0 statement he . said that following the serious allegations that had been made, he . wanted to make it \u2018quite clear\u2019 that he was \u2018innocent of these charges . and intend to fight them vigorously\u2019. He added:\u00a0 \u2018I will now put all my . efforts into clearing my name and proving my innocence.\u2019 Charged: Michael Le Vell has been charged with child sex offences, whose real name is Michael Turner, will appear in court later this month . Thanking friends, family and fans for . their continued support, he said he would now concentrate on preparing . his defence. An ITV spokesman said: \u2018Given the serious nature of these . charges, Michael Le Vell will not be appearing in Coronation Street . pending the outcome of legal proceedings. \u2018It would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.\u2019 Greater Manchester Police said the . rethink over charging Le Vell had followed a review of evidence by the . Crown Prosecution Service and related to \u2018offences against a child . between 2001 and 2010\u2019. Alison Levitt QC, principal legal . adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: \u2018I have very . carefully reviewed the evidence in this case and I have concluded that . there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge . Michael Robert Turner with a number of sexual offences.\u2019 Le Vell will appear in court in Manchester later this month. Originally from Manchester, Le Vell began his acting career in the Oldham Theatre Workshop. He joined Coronation Street in 1983 . and quickly endeared himself to fans who have followed the trials and . tribulations of Kevin, from being Brian Tilsley\u2019s apprentice mechanic . through to his stormy marriage to Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, and . fathering two teenage girls as well as a child from his affair with . Molly Dobbs. Early years: Le Vell in an episode of Coronation Street from 1987 . Born Michael Turner in Newton Heath, Manchester, Michael Le Vell is best known for the role of garage mechanic Kevin Webster, in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street. After taking an interest in amateur dramatics while at school, Le Vell began his acting career in the Oldham Theatre Workshop. He landed the role on Coronation Street after a making short guest appearance in the show as the paperboy Neil Grimshaw. He had attended an audition at Granada Studios for the series Scully, where he met casting director Judy Hayfield who presumed he was there to audition for Coronation Street. She asked him to return the following day to audition and he was offered the part. He first appeared as Webster in the soap on October 19 1983, moving in with Hilda Ogden as her lodger and getting a job as an apprentice mechanic with Brian Tilsley. Le Vell has featured in some of Coronation Street's most explosive storylines, most recently Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs. After twenty-six years in the role, Le Vell pledged to carry on playing Kevin Webster because he still viewed it as 'the best job on television'. He has also starred in the BBC shows Fame is the Spur and One by One. During the 1980s Le Vell became something of a gay icon and would receive a high volume of fan mail from gay men. This was reportedly due to the fact he wore tight jeans and a moustache and appeared on screen with his left ear pierced. He later claimed that the attention from gay men ended as soon after he shaved off his moustache. He married Coronation Street Co-star Janette Beverley in October 1986. They couple have two children together but split last year. He was a member of the celebrity 'All Stars' football team which play charity matches and was hospitalised during a match in 2007.

The stores are running promotions where three of their \u00a34 chickens can be bought for \u00a310 . We've already seen battles over milk prices \u2013 now supermarkets are slashing the cost of chickens in their fierce fight to win customers. Waitrose has halved the price of its 1.3kg \u2018Essentials\u2019 chicken from \u00a34.23 to just \u00a32.11 in the last few days \u2013 making it even cheaper than budget brands Aldi and Lidl, who are selling 1.25kg birds for \u00a32.99. Tesco and Asda are running promotions where three of their \u00a34 chickens (weighing 1.35kg each) can be bought for \u00a310 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a33.33 a bird. Sainsbury\u2019s has permanently cut the cost of its 1.35kg chicken by \u00a31 \u2013 from \u00a34.50 to \u00a33.50. And Marks & Spencer is offering its 1.1kg Oakham chicken, which is normally \u00a34, at two for \u00a37. Shoppers will undoubtedly welcome the discounts \u2013 but critics are warning that poultry welfare could suffer as a result, and some farmers may be forced out of business. They are already being squeezed on milk prices as supermarkets compete to offer the cheapest deals, with more than 1,000 dairy farms told this week that their payments are being delayed due to a financial crisis at the biggest dairy co-operative, First Milk. Poultry farmers now fear a crash in profits, too, as supermarkets turn their attention to chicken in a bid to entice shoppers through their doors. Chicken is Britain\u2019s biggest-selling meat, with around 800million birds reared each year for our tables. And, as it\u2019s a staple food for most households, consumers watch its price more carefully than they do for most goods. It may also be that retailers are trying to reverse a decline in the sale of chicken, following fears about its safety last autumn. The Food Standards Agency revealed then that 70 per cent of whole raw chickens sold by the leading chains were contaminated with the potentially deadly food- poisoning bug campylobacter. Almost one in five of fresh roasting chickens \u2013 18 per cent \u2013 were contaminated with the highest levels of the bug. And more than one in 20 carried the germ on the outside of the pack, meaning people picking them up from the shelf to check a price could fall ill. The latest figures by retail analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel suggest consumers may have reacted to the revelations, with 6.8 per cent less chicken being bought in the 12 weeks to December 7 than during the same period in 2013. Scroll down for video . Tesco and Asda have chicken promotions, whereas\u00a0Sainsbury\u2019s has permanently cut the cost of its 1.35kg chicken by \u00a31 . However, Waitrose, which is selling the cheapest chicken, claimed its price cut was part of a wider half-price promotion on meat. And it insisted that its farmers were not skimping on animal-welfare standards or quality as a result of the low price. \u2018The hens have 20 per cent more space than the industry standard, giving our birds the room they need to move freely,\u2019 a spokesman said. \u2018Our standards meet the RSPCA\u2019s recommendations and have the support of other key organisations such as Compassion in World Farming.\u2019 Last night the National Farmers Union warned supermarkets against using chicken as a loss leader (a product sold below its market price to entice shoppers into the store). The union\u2019s chief poultry adviser Gary Ford said: \u2018Poultry farmers are not averse to promotional activity. 'However, selling products as a loss leader must not be at the expense of producers and others in the supply chain.

        "article": "What is tech but yesterday's dreams realized? From touchscreen tablets to virtual reality, it all has to start in somebody's mind before it ends up on the shelves of a store (or, let's be honest, in an Amazon warehouse somewhere in the middle of nowhere). No, we here at CNN Tech haven't dreamed up any technological breakthroughs that will change the world. At least none that we're willing to discuss publicly. But we do think about tech stuff a lot and ponder how to make it better. So as this new year dawns, we came up with these five wishes for the tech world in 2013. Are they all likely to come true? Almost certainly not. But some might, and the others may be useful as conversation starters if nothing else. Let us know what your tech hopes and dreams for 2013 are in the comments. The Wozniak Initiative . You don't have to be an Apple fanatic to love The Woz. Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple who is known more as a gadget geek than a ruthless businessman, showed where his heart is when asked about the constant barrage of lawsuits flying back and forth between tech companies these days. Apple sued Samsung. Samsung sued Apple. Apple sued Google. Google sued Apple. And so on. And so on. Wozniak, who has dropped out of the business end of things at Apple, had a solution. \"I hate it ...\" Wozniak said. \"I wish everybody would just agree to exchange all the patents and everybody can build the best forms they want to use everybody's technologies.\" We're with Woz. If the consumer-tech titans quit squabbling over the details and use all the tools at their disposal to make great products, we as consumers win, right? But we're not holding our breath. Estimated chance: 2% . The perfect social site . More than 1 billion of us have made social networking a regular part of our lives. So why is everyone so unhappy? With Facebook, if it's not concerns about privacy, it's irritation at ads or frustration with \"friends\" who share those stupid \"click this or you hate puppies\" posts. Twitter's microbursts of news and info, much of it snarky commentary, definitely aren't for everybody. (That said, can even the biggest Twitter haters agree with us that \"Twitter is for twits\" is an old, tired, unoriginal insult and move on?) So let's hope for the perfect networking site to come along out of nowhere in 2013. Failing that, maybe the existing sites will put their differences aside and combine the best of each into a single super-network. (Google+ sure does look pretty. But how many folks do you know who use it on purpose?) Oh ... and our pipe-dream social network will be bankrolled by some billionaire as a public service, so there'll be no annoying ads or worries about your data being used to serve advertisers. Hear that, billionaires? Get busy. Estimated chance: 7% . Affordable 3-D printers . OK ... so, \"affordable\" is one of those things that's definitely in the eye of the beholder. And by some early-adopter standards, the $2,200 or so you can plunk down for a MakerBot Replicator or other 3-D printer qualifies as a bargain. But we'd love for 2013 to be the year that these living-in-the-future devices gain enough traction for the inevitable price drop that always eventually comes with new technology. (Witness: The $1,389 VCR) The potential of 3-D printers is one of the truly exciting promises of emerging tech. The ability to reproduce tiny parts of bigger, more complicated objects -- say, cameras, appliances, etc. -- could help consumers extend the lifespans of our increasingly disposable gadgets. But, let's be honest. We'd probably use ours to make action figures or dinosaur skulls or a bunch of bad guys from Doctor Who. So, yeah. Hurry up with that price drop. Estimated chance: 46% . Made in the U.S.A. It's not just about the goodwill they'd get from customers, although there would probably be no shortage of that. But it's increasingly looking like good business for top tech companies to start making their products in the United States. In 2012, we saw glimmers of hope. Apple announced that it will begin manufacturing one of its computers in the United States in 2013. Lenovo, the Chinese electronics company, announced it will be opening its first U.S. factory in North Carolina. And Google gave \"Made in the U.S.A.\" a shot as well, with its ill-fated Nexus Q device. Apple, among other tech firms, has taken some lumps over reports of poor worker conditions on its assembly lines in China. Now, with production, transportation and other costs in China increasing, experts say it might not be long before it makes financial sense to move factories back to the States. As the U.S. economy continues to slowly rebound, let's hope 2013 sees its fair share of that move. Estimated chance: 50% . Battery life . We get it. We ask our smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices to do more, and do it faster, every year. We also want them to be small enough to act as fashion accessories (even as their display screens get bigger). And we realize that all that surfing, texting, streaming and downloading burns power. But is it too much for us to dream of a day when we can go from sunup to sundown without having to stay tethered to a USB port? A day when we can stream music or videos without growing anxious about preserving the precious remaining drops of juice in our gadgets? There's some room for optimism here. MIT researchers say a new amplifier design they're working on could double battery life in smartphones. Research on consumer applications is underway, and, if we're lucky, it will mean durable, environmentally friendlier batteries that will make finding public spots next to power outlets less of a blood sport. Estimated chance: We have no idea, but our fingers are crossed .",

        "article": "Jose Mourinho has heaped praised on Diego Costa after the Chelsea striker took his Premier League goals tally up to four from just thee games. The \u00a332million summer arrival scored in the first and last minute to help Chelsea win 6-3 at Everton on Saturday evening - ensuring the Spaniard has scored in all three of his Blues appearances so far. Mourinho gave credit to the former Atletico Madrid striker on his finishing, but the Chelsea boss also highlighted the 25-year-old's overall impact on the team since moving to Stamford Bridge. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho: Happy with Diego Costa, unhappy with Everton . Running the show: Diego Costa scored twice for Chelsea in their 6-3 win at Everton . 'Diego [Costa] had three chances and scored two goals and one was a good save from Tim Howard, Mourinho told Sky Sports 'So he he is a good finisher, but he doesn't just give us that touch. 'He participates in everything, even in defence. I can remember him making a defensive tackle almost on the edge of our box. He is giving us what we expect. Costa has made a huge impact since joining the west London side over the summer and his performances drew praise from team-mate John Terry as well as Jamie Redknapp. One that got away: Although Costa scored twice, he was denied a potential hat-trick by Tim Howard . 'He's been brilliant,' Terry told Sky Sports. 'I played against him in the Champions League and realised he was a top player but when you see him every day he's got everything and he's got off to a flying start with us and long may it continue because that was the difference today.' Redknapp added: 'That\u2019s the difference. He [Costa] is a game changer. People like that - that\u2019s what you pay big money for. You lose David Luiz and bring in him and Fabregas. What a piece of business that is.' Although Costa scored twice, the striker managed to get involved with many confrontations during the game with opposition players. Confrontation: Costa's reaction after Seamus Coleman's own goal led to an an angry response from Howard . You're booking me: Costa was booked after an on-going scuffle with Coleman in the second half . One scuffle with Seamus Coleman saw the striker booked but former Chelsea front man Eidur Gudjohnsen claims it is just part of his make-up. 'That\u2019s the character he [Costa] is, Gudjohnsen told Sky Sports. 'I think we saw when he played Chelsea last year, he got involved with John Terry a bit. 'I am convinced that Chelsea can win this season \u2013 not only because they look strong, but they\u2019ve got a lot of depth in their squad. None of the other teams have convinced me \u2013 look at Man City losing at home. Chelsea have had a great day.'",

        "article": "Click here to find out more from our brilliant Match Zone service - including Paul Pogba's heat map . Ecuador went out of the World Cup with a display of heroic defiance which shook France, the new contenders for the crown, to their aristocratic roots. The unfancied South Americans blazed another thrilling episode into this magnificent World Cup even after Manchester United\u2019s Antonio Valencia was sent off early in the second half. That decision by the Ivory Coast referee could not discourage Ecuador from going desperately close to overcoming a French team who have become many people\u2019s latest fancy to return here to the Maracana for the final. A lot of hearts went out with Ecuador as their electric counter-attacks had Didier Deschamps\u2019 men scrambling to keep them out. Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was almost as busy in the French goal as the flying Alexander Dominguez at the other end. What had begun as a rather tame affair finished with an explosion of chances in both goalmouths. Goalless it finished. A bore it was not. As close as they came: Antoine Griezmann hits the bar as Ecuador scramble to clear their lines . Flying in: Antonio Valencia goes in hard, with the Ecuador captain's studs running down Lucas Digne's left leg . In agony: Lucas Digne lies injured after a nasty clash with Antonio Valencia . Anxious moments: France players surround the stricken Lucas Digne before Antonio Valencia sees red for a poor tackle . Marching orders: Antonio Valencia is sent off by referee Noumandiez Doue after raking his studs down Lucas Digne's left leg . Ecuador: Dominguez 8, Paredes 6.5, Guagua 7.5, Erazo 6, Ayovi 6, A Valencia 4.5, Minda 6, Noboa 5.5 (Caicedo 89), Montero 6 (Ibarra 63), Arroyo 7 (Achillier 82), E Valencia 8.

When the breathless end came, France were heading for a date with Nigeria, Ecuador for home. However, the concept of this French team as ready to surpass the likes of Brazil and Argentina was not given any added traction.Beneath all the thrills there a was a back story on which the French are building their aspirations. The . battle for Karim Benzema was being joined in earnest by Real Madrid and . Arsenal, even as France breathlessly awaited a further sign that this . man is riding a magic carpet similar to that on which Zinedine Zidane . bore them to World Cup glory. The French regard Le Mistral, the hot . southern wind which comes to them from the deserts of North Africa, as . being full of mystery and wonder.That superstition was heightened . when Zidane, born in Marseilles of Algerian parents, arose to spirit . them to their first world championship in Paris in 1998. Sixteen . years later Benzema, born in Lyon to parents from a deeply spiritual . corner of Algeria, is emerging as their exotic new talisman. To . support that belief, he went into this match against Ecuador\u2019s hopefuls . only one behind the four-goal leaders in the race for the Golden Boot, . Neymar and Lionel Messi. Not that he looked like catching them on this . outing. Still the French see it as another positive omen that on the . very day they formally closed out qualification for the last 16 Zidane . has accepted his first managerial appointment, at the club which is . determined to keep Benzema. Less romantically, the recruitment of Benzema\u2019s idol as coach of their second team is a piece of clever opportunism by Real. The . prospect of working in the same environment as Zidane, on a daily . basis, would make it all the more of a wrench for Benzema to up sticks . and move to north London. A persuasion perhaps as great as the hugely . enriching new contract with which Real are preparing to welcome him back . to Spain from this World Cup. It counters the attraction to Benzema of playing under Arsene Wenger, the iconic French manager at the Emirates. VIDEO France fans optimistic about knockout stage . Just wide: Paul Pogba went close with this late header . Flying lesson: Alex Ibarra takes a trip under pressure from Lucas Digne . Hands on: Karim Benzema gets to grips with Frickson Erazo . Holding on: Alexander Dominguez of Ecuador makes a save as France threaten to break the deadlock . Girls' night out: The significant others of Yohan Cabaye, Loic Remy, Mamadou Sakho, Bacary Sagna and Patrice Evra enjoy a night out at the Maracana . Arsenal . are hoping also that one of their moles in the French camp, Olivier . Giroud, can excite Benzema to the possibility of them partnering each . other in the Premier League the way they work together for France. Albeit . not from the off in this game, in which Benzema was nudged forward . positionally to orthodox centre-forward and Giroud rested. But these . players will not be able to resist comparing two contracts, Giroud\u2019s . existing deal at Arsenal and the bonanza being offered for Benzema to . keep playing his club football in Spain. And it has to be doubtful if . Arsenal will be either willing or able to match such astronomic wages, . especially if Benzema pushes them yet higher with more goals in these . finals. Such has Benzema\u2019s impact been on this shimmering tournament . already that the French have as good as forgotten the grief which . consumed their nation when Franck Ribery was taken from them by injury. Ribery, after all, had been described by Zidane as \u2018the new jewel of French football\u2019. But . this team came into this tournament sparkling without him, so . brilliantly in their first two games that they have begun daring to . dream of winning their second World Cup. Ecuador have brought a . little perspective to that notion. They entered the Maracana expecting . that if they were to join Les Bleus they would have to resist being . demolished the way the Swiss were by France in game two of this group. Switzerland, . despite that five-goal hammering, were in pole position to follow . France through as they took on a demoralised Honduras. Ecuador . gleaned hope that they might match the Swiss result from the practice . of Deschamps rotating his players from match to match. High riser: Karim Benzema shrugs off the attentions of Juan Carlos Paredes to go close in the first half . High boot: Bacary Sagna gets some studs on his torso during the Maracana encounter . Hard in: Blaise Matuidi skips a tackle from Christian Noboa . Touching distance: Lucas Digne manages to escape the attentions of Antonio Valencia . Holding on: Hugo Lloris collects a loose ball to deny Ecuador a goalscoring chance . Patrice Evra . also took a turn on the bench, while Southampton\u2019s contribution to this . World Cup was expanded by Morgan Schneiderlein being given a first World . Cup game here in place of Yohan Cabaye in midfield. A pity club-mates Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw were not still here to see it. Scheniderlin announced his arrival on this lofty stage with a feisty tussle with Antonio Valencia. Of . the Premier League contingent on view, Newcastle\u2019s Moussa Sissoko . threatened in the early exchanges and Lloris came out smartly to smother . at the feet of Ecuador\u2019s other Valencia. He was to be even busier . later. And while Antonio was not playing badly, Enner Valencia . continued to stretch the French defence, notably with a close-range . header which Lloris again did well to keep out. Clearing his lines: Laurent Koscielny removes the danger as Enner Valencia advances . Aerial battle: Ecuador's Jorge Guagua heads the ball to his teammates as France's Antoine Griezmann defends . A cause for concern: Enner Valencia left the field after suffering an injury in the first half . Marked man: Segundo Castillo keeps a close eye on dangerman Karim Benzema . Telescopic leg: Mamadou Sakho sticks out a limb to deny Enner Valencia . Ecuador kept pressing into the second half, even after Valencia\u2019s 55th minute sending off. After . Dominguez brilliantly turned a close range effort from Stuart Broad . lookalike Antoine Griezmann against a post, the head bandaged Noboa went . clear on the counter, only to scoop his shot wide of Lloris. A . previously somewhat tepid game was now fully ignited \u2013 although the . French still marginally held the upper hand - this firefight\u00a0 was not in . their script. Lloris had to pull out a huge save from substitute Ibarra to keep it goalless. In . the end it was France who were grateful for the final whistle, France . who celebrated, France who will field their best team from now. But it was Ecuador who the crowd rose to cheer.",

        "article": "Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann has revealed that if he was in charge at the club he would only have signed under-fire striker Mario Balotelli as a last resort in the summer transfer window. Hamann, who last week criticised Balotelli for swapping shirts with Real Madrid\u2019s Pepe at half-time while the Reds were 3-0 down against the Spanish giants, says he would have evaluated every other option available before signing the controversial Italian. In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail at the London Sports Writing Festival he said: \u2018I would have taken Balotelli on the last day of the window, but not before. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Mario Balotelli continues to struggle for form in a Liverpool shirt, again firing a blank in the 0-0 draw with Hull . Balotelli courted controversy this week when he swapped shirts with Real Madrid's Pepe at half-time . Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann says the club should have signed Balotelli only as a last resort . \u2018I would have tried to look at every other option which was out there to see if the right player could be found and a deal could be done. \u2018And then on the last day if you don\u2019t get anyone and he (Balotelli) is still keen on coming to the club I would have taken him, but I wouldn\u2019t have taken him a week before \u2013 that\u2019s for sure. \u2018Having said that I\u2019d rather have him at the club than not have him at all, because I think he can produce the moments of magic which can win you games. We just haven\u2019t seen that yet.' Despite his criticism of Balotelli last week, Hamann insists the 24-year-old is being made a scapegoat at Liverpool to disguise their poor form, with the Reds already eight points off leaders Chelsea, having played a game more. He added: \u2018He is part of a team that is struggling and is not playing well but all the blame seems to be directed onto him \u2013 he\u2019s an easy target. Balotelli tries to beat Hull's James Chester and goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic to the ball . Balotelli appeals in vain for a penalty after colliding with Hull defender Alex Bruce . \u2018He is not playing any differently to what he has done in the last five years. You know what you\u2019re getting with Balotelli, and the only difference with him now to previous years is that he\u2019s not scoring. \u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as good as people make out but he is a very talented player and could be a success at Liverpool. \u2018I\u2019ve been critical of Mario recently (the shirt swapping incident), but I feel the criticism elsewhere has been overboard in particular after the Real Madrid game. \u2018He shouldn\u2019t have swapped shirts with Pepe but ultimately it had no bearing on the result and the way Liverpool played. \u2018They\u2019ve been under par most of the season and have struggled for results and that isn\u2019t Mario\u2019s fault. He needs support now from everyone at Liverpool because the last thing he needs is people hitting him over the head with a sledgehammer.\u2019",

        "article": "(CNN) -- There's a moment, when singer LP performs the song \"Into the Wild,\" that her face tightens and she purses her lips, even as she keeps singing. It happened show after show at the South by Southwest music festival, whether on sunny daytime stages, in dark clubs, or while rocking a ukulele, solo, in the middle of an Austin, Texas, street. She is trying not to smile. She knows the line that will make people recognize the song, and its singer. Maybe they saw her belt it at Sayers Club in Los Angeles, or they're among the millions that watched it on YouTube, or they remember how it burst from a Citi commercial as a rock climber ascended a 400-foot sandstone tower: \"Somebody left the gate open, you know we got lost on the way.\" Those big notes give her away: Not Laura Pergolizzi, songwriter, but LP, the singer crowds have heard, but never heard of. The artist, whose CD/DVD, \"Into the Wild,\" debuts Tuesday; who'll be on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on Wednesday; and whose album with Green Day producer Rob Cavallo will come out later this year. Always after that line, she knows, the murmurs start. \"I see a few of them, every time, look at their friend and go, 'Ohhhh.' It's kind of funny and embarrassing at the same time,\" LP said during an interview at SXSW. \"And awesome.\" The singing, the recognition -- they weren't part of any big plan. Pergolizzi's dad was a lawyer. Her mom sang opera, but gave it up when she had a family. Growing up in New York, they listened to oldies, not pop radio. But after her mom passed away in 1997, Pergolizzi finished high school, moved to Manhattan and found music was what made her happy. \"I didn't know anybody, I didn't have any connections,\" she said. \"The first time I wrote a song, I couldn't really believe -- 'Can you just do that? You're just allowed?' I never thought about songs on the radio, and who wrote them.\" She was first signed as an artist on Island Def Jam, then RedOne. The deals never shook out, but she gained a reputation as a writer who could churn out dozens of tunes to suit any voice or sound. She wrote Rihanna's \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" and chunks of Heidi Montag's album, \"Superficial.\" Christina Aguilera and Backstreet Boys cut her work. There are songs in the works with Joe Walsh, Rita Ora and Isa Summers from Florence and the Machine. Writing was so demanding that she left New York in 2010 and moved to Los Angeles. She'd show up to sessions with a ukulele -- a $60 instrument she'd taught herself to play using Beatles songs posted online -- and strung together melodies and lyrics that worked. Creating pop for other people made her understand what songs need, she said, but as an artist turned writer, she was compassionate. She understood what it was like to sit in a room with people trying to decide your voice and put words in your mouth. \"I was having a nice anonymous little time as a writer,\" she said. \"I really was on the writer path. I was sort of minding my own business. I loved making a living in music.\" Sometimes, for fun, she'd show up at Bardot, Soho House or Sayers Club in Los Angeles for one- or two-song cover sets -- \"Barracuda\" by Heart, \"The Funeral\" by Band of Horses, \"Uninvited\" by Alanis Morissette or \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night,\" the Lead Belly version Nirvana remade. The crowds at music industry hangouts always liked her; she was one of them. One night, when it seemed right, she pulled out her ukulele and played \"Into the Wild\" on stage. The audience exploded. She remembers people chanting her name, once adopted just for convenience, later because it felt right: Not Laura -- LP. \"When I'm behind a big song, I feel like I can do big things,\" she said. That moment was a big one. She signed to Warner Bros. Records (which is owned by CNN's parent company, Time Warner), found managers she trusted, and began to think more about what her sound should be -- not what others wanted, or what other singers needed, but what hit all the highs and lows in her vocal range and personality. \"The thrill of writing songs for other people, when you get that right, that person's soul speaks to that song, you've done them a favor and the world a favor,\" she said. \"That's what writing is all about -- you're always trying to get the real picture. \"I wrote a bunch of songs I feel only I can sing.\" It's not an anonymous life now. For long days at SXSW, Pergolizzi had managers, PR people, photographers and a band around her. The singer had a signature look -- a pillow of tight black curls around her face, broken-in black boots, simple silver jewelry. She also had about seven black jackets that all looked more or less the same. She looked on the outside like she feels on the inside, LP said, and finally has the instruments and stage to express it. Crowds piled in to see her in Austin, or stopped to listen when they heard the line, one they all recognized. They'd always look up to see the person it was coming from. Maybe it all looks like a character, LP said -- the new city, the name change, the uniform, the ukulele. But she knows now which songs are hers. \"I think everybody needs to find out who they are and who their, like, inner superhero is, or who you like to be,\" she said. \"The world would be a better place if everyone was doing what the hell they wanted to do and being who they wanted to be. \"I hope they do.\"",
        "summary": "(CNN) -- There's a moment, when singer LP performs the song \"Into the Wild,\" that her face tightens and she purses her lips, even as she keeps singing. Maybe they saw her belt it at Sayers Club in Los Angeles, or they're among the millions that watched it on YouTube, or they remember how it burst from a Citi commercial as a rock climber ascended a 400-foot sandstone tower: \"Somebody left the gate open, you know we got lost on the way.\" I was having a nice anonymous little time as a writer,\" she said. \" The crowds at music industry hangouts always liked her; she was one of them.

        "article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Negative headlines about drugs and sex abuse charges greatly diminished Michael Jackson's earning potential, an entertainment consultant said. Jackson's album sales dropped sharply from his peak and his \"likability\" rating turned dramatically negative after \"significantly negative headlines, drug abuse and other issues,\" Eric Briggs testified. Briggs' testimony in the wrongful death trial of AEG Live is intended to counter an expert hired by Jackson lawyers who concluded the pop icon would have earned another $1.5 billion from world tours had he not died while preparing for his comeback concerts. AEG Live placed a big bet on Jackson's ability to sell tickets when it signed him to a three-year deal for his \"This Is It\" tour. While the company worked hard to convince Jackson in 2009 to let them produce and promote the concerts, it paid Briggs more than $700,000 to prepare testimony for this trial questioning Jackson's star power. In fact, AEG Live executives bragged at the time about how Jackson's first 50 London concerts sold out in record time with enough potential buyers lined up to sell out another 50 shows. If a jury decides that AEG Live is liable for Jackson's death, his lost earnings potential would factor into their determination of damages to be paid by the concert promoter. Michael Jackson's drug use explored in trial . Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending it negligently hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death. AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson, not their executives, chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray and that they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. They contend the singer was so deceptive and secretive about his medical treatments and drug use that even his family did not know. To help make their case, they'll play video of Jackson's youngest brother Randy being questioned about it. His testimony is expected to be shown to jurors after Brigg's testimony is concluded Wednesday. Jackson's oldest sister Rebbie and ex-wife Debbie Rowe are also lined up to testify in the coming days. AEG Live is compelling their testimony, hoping to get revelations about Jackson's drug use. Tuesday marks the 59th day of testimony in the trial, which the judge said could take another six weeks in a Los Angeles courtroom. MJ's Q score . Briggs testified that he studied \"Q score\" data for Jackson, the trend of his album sales and his stability to conclude that Jackson had a low chance of earning money from endorsements and sponsorships. An entertainment industry analyst hired by Jackson lawyers testified he was \"reasonably certain\" Jackson would have earned $300 million from endorsements and sponsorships. Briggs disputed the estimate, saying that while Jackson was \"a great performer\" companies decide which celebrities to align their products with based on \"likability\" as measured by \"Q scores.\" Jackson's \"Q score\" in 1993 was in line with the average male musical performer, with about one person of every two surveyed saying they liked him, Briggs said. That was the year Jackson announced he had a problem with painkillers, and he entered rehab. His score became dramatically negative over the next decade, Briggs said. By 2006, a year after he was acquitted in a child molestation trial, more than seven people said they disliked Jackson for every one who said they liked him, Briggs testified. Companies would be \"very anxious\" about putting someone with such negative \"likability\" next to their products, he said. Jackson lawyer Brian Panish will have a chance to question Briggs about his conclusions Tuesday. AEG Live exec: 'Celine Dion's bigger than MJ'",

        "article": "An examination of a mountain lion killed by a Kentucky Fish and Wildlife official has found that it was a 125-pound male that appeared to be young and healthy. But Fish and Wildlife officials still don't know whether it was a wild animal or one that escaped from captivity. An agency officer thought it best to 'dispatch' the mountain lion after a concerned farmer spotted it in northern Bourbon County on Monday. Scroll down for video . First sighting in 150 years: A young, healthy cougar found stuck in a tree in Kentucky was shot and killed Monday (file photo) 'It seemed to be in very healthy condition, and they determined pretty quickly that it didn't look like it had traveled long distances on foot,' agency spokesman Mark Marraccini said. Marraccini says the lion was killed because it was roaming free near a populated area, making it a public safety issue. 'If that cat had left that tree, it would have disappeared into the brush and it was a fairly populated area,' Marraccini told the Courier-Journal. 'I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be handled that way.' He said if the mountain lion was a wild animal, it apparently would be the first one confirmed in Kentucky since before the Civil War. 'But that is a pretty big if,'' he said. 'They took some measurements today, but that's certainly not enough to go on without looking at everything in total.' 'Dispatch it': The animal was treed by a dog in northern Bourbon before a wildlife official chose to 'dispatch it' out of public safety concerns . Amy Rodrigues, a staff biologist for the Mountain Lion Foundation, disagrees with Marraccini's assessment. 'If you're a deer, they're a little dangerous. If you're a human, not so much,' she told the Courier-Journal. 'Attacks on people are not that common. There have only been 22 deaths in the last 120 years.' The animal's DNA will be sent to an out-of-state wildlife lab to determine whether its genetic material matches any wild populaitons. 'They can determine the origin,' Marraccini said, though it won't be fast. He said it could take weeks to get an answer. Mountain lions, which also are known as cougars and panthers, are the largest cats found in North America. They were once native to the area but are most relegated to western states. They are now believed to number around 30,000 in North America.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Former French national coach Raymond Domenech is suing the French Football Federation (FFF) for unfair dismissal, demanding 2.9 million euros after his sacked in the wake of France's disastrous World Cup campaign. Domenech was fired by the FFF in September for \"serious error\" and -- under French law -- a person dismissed under such circumstances has no right to severance pay, although they can dispute the charge before an employment tribunal. Domenech's lawyer, Jean-Yves Connesson, told AFP: \"We are requesting 2.9 million euros spread over two payments. \"The first is for 400,000 euros and includes compensation for dismissal. The second is for professional and moral prejudice and is worth three years salary,\" He added: \"You don't manage a collective crisis by sacking one individual. An amicable parting of ways was a possibility. \"The federation came up with totally unfounded reasons for the sacking, and went through with it in an irregular, brutal and aggressive manner.\" Domenech lost his job after France failed to qualify from the group stages in South Africa, amid player unrest that saw his squad boycott a training session. However, Connesson believes his client has a good chance of winning his case. He told AFP: \"We can't forget Domenech is the only coach to have qualified France for three consecutive major international tournaments (two World Cups and one European Championships). \"And we sack him for a serious error! Those are not valid reasons and we want to prove that in front of a judge. \"It is difficult for him to bounce back.

        "article": "(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama called Pakistan's president Sunday to express condolences over the airstrike that killed 24 soldiers near the Afghanistan border more than a week ago, the White House said in a statement. \"The president made clear that this regrettable incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan and reiterated the United States' strong commitment to a full investigation,\" the statement said. \"The two presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship, which is critical to the security of both nations, and they agreed to stay in close touch.\" The conversation between Obama and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was the latest bid to address strained relations between the two nations after a NATO airstrike killed the Pakistani troops on November 26. After the attack, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told CNN that Pakistan was re-evaluating its relationship with the United States. NATO later called the subsequent mass casualties caused by the strike \"tragic (and) unintended.\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have called the incident a \"tragedy\" and offered condolences, though Washington has not issued a formal apology. The issue of U.S. and fellow NATO forces coming into Pakistan has been an especially sensitive topic in that country since May, when U.S. commandos killed then al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad without Pakistani leaders' consent . During an exclusive interview last week with CNN, Gilani said the country wants to maintain its relationship with the United States as long as there is mutual respect and respect for Pakistani sovereignty. Asked directly if Pakistan is getting that respect, the prime minister said: \"At the moment (it is) not.\" \"If I can't protect the sovereignty of my country, how can we say that this is mutual respect and mutual interest?\" he asked rhetorically. Pakistan has taken several steps aimed at NATO since the attack. That includes an announcement Friday, by Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, that NATO and International Security Assistance Force supplies could no longer be routed through Pakistan. The country has served a vital supply route for allied forces who have been fighting for more than a decade in neighboring Afghanistan.",

More than fifty pink flamingos have been found dead in southern France, victims of freezing weather conditions that have gripped Europe over the past weeks. Firemen who combed waters in Gruissan, in the Aude region, said the birds succumbed to the cold after being trapped in the frozen water and left unable to fly away. The League for Protection of Birds (OPL) picked up some of the other fragile flamingos in the region to transport them to a bird park in Camargue in southern France. Scroll down for videos . Frozen to death: A fireman recovers the body of one of the dead flamingos from icy waters in southern France . Sapped energy reserves: A fireman hands a severely weakened flamingo to his colleague as a major operation got under way to rescue any survivors . Rare occurrence: The cold weather has sapped their energy reserves, preventing the birds from flying away from the perilously cold water . Francis Morlon, Director of the OPL, said: 'These birds have suffered from the cold wave. The ten days of cold have weakened them and so their energy reserves have reduced. 'And what happened was that, on Monday, we had winds of 120km/h and so the birds were not able to flee the peak of the cold and all the ponds of the region have frozen. 'It's pretty rare. Really, the last time we recovered so many flamingos was in 1985. After that, every year we catch young flamingos weakened by the cold, or who face other problems like food etc, but never on such a large scale.' As the birds were being bandaged in black cloth and put into large cartons for transportation, firemen combed nearby ponds to look for other flamingos trapped in the ice, a task made difficult by the slippery ground and by the birds themselves who tried hard to get away. In a flap: Efforts to rescue the birds was made all the more difficult because of their instinct to get away . Macabre: The flamingos were found dead and dying in waters in the Aude region of southern France . Hope: Firemen pack the birds into boxes ready to be transported to a bird park in Camargue . Back on their feet: Some of the rescued flamingos regain their strength at the bird sanctuary . Meanwhile, Serbia was struggling to keep its power system going after weeks of record-low temperatures in Europe that have snarled traffic, frozen rivers and challenged officials to step up outreach to the vulnerable homeless. The Serb state power company said its system cannot hold on for much longer and authorities urged citizens to save electricity in an appeal aired on national television. Europe's big freeze so far has claimed hundreds of lives, mostly of homeless people, while tens of thousands more remain trapped in remote villages in Bosnia and Serbia and other hard-hit areas. Plunging temperatures: A boat makes its way through floating ice on the river Elbe in Hamburg, northern Germany, today . Frozen still: A man stands on the banks of the river Danube, where shipping has been halted by massive ice floes . Big freeze: Boats are left locked in the ice on the Danube in Belgrade, Serbia . Homeless people are queueing up for free rooms in an Austrian brothel after its owner said it would be unfair not to do everything he could during the current cold spell. Peter Laskaris (above), owner of the Red Rooms Laufhaus in the capital Vienna, is offering 10 people a night a bed in his brothel, including a hot shower and a hot meal. He said: 'We are not really doing much business in the current cold weather anyway and it is the school holidays - a lot of people are off away with their families. 'Lots of our rooms are empty and it seemed a shame not to use them for a good cause.'In these cold temperatures nobody should be left out on the streets.' But he added: 'Other services are not included.' In many European capitals, authorities . have set up extra shelters for the homeless to help them survive the . cold snap that has seen temperatures sink as low as -33F (-36C). In Berlin, rescue vans loaded with food and clean sheets are picking up those in need and taking them to shelters. 'I witnessed a man laying on the street and people were passing by, not caring about him,' said Wolfgang Gerhard, a pastor who works for the Berlin city mission and drives one of its two rescue vehicles. 'And that's what moves me: that someone could die on a street and nobody calls an ambulance.' The cold and snow have blocked roads, halted shipping on rivers and forced schools to close in many countries. Massive ice floes have halted shipping on parts of the mighty Danube, Europe's main commercial waterway, which winds 2,860kilometres (1,777miles) from Germany to the Black Sea. Authorities in Serbia plan to use explosives to break the ice to try to prevent flooding of the kind that hit Greece and Bulgaria on Monday and Tuesday, leaving dozens of homes under water and at least eight dead. Elsewhere in the region, rescue services have been using helicopters to reached stranded people and deliver food to snowed-in regions. TV stations showed images of people digging tunnels to get out of their homes in the village of Rubla in eastern Romania, where dozens of communities were left without electricity or water. Some people said they were melting snow and drinking it because they couldn't get fresh water from frozen wells. Used banknotes are being compressed into blocks and handed out to hard-up families to heat their homes during the current freezing weather in Hungary. Cash taken out of circulation is shredded and reformed to make fuel for burning as temparatures plunge to minus 20 degrees in the eastern European country.

He added: 'Every year, we withdraw about a quarter of all banknotes from circulation or around 200 billion forints. 'Until now, we hand been incinerating them, but because they burn so well we are now reproccessing them as fuel.

Jack Littlewood (pictured), 13, was placed in 'isolation' at his school in Wardley, Greater Manchester, because of his short back and sides cut, his mother claims . But his short haircut was picked up on and the teenager was placed in a classroom for the day with children who had misbehaved at St Ambrose Barlow RC High School. He was issued with two days of isolation as punishment and a note was sent home explaining why. But the following day he was told to rejoin his classmates because his hair looked more acceptable. His mother has now written to the school to complain. The letter reads: 'It is disgusting he is not getting the education he is entitled to whilst in isolation and I will be taking this matter further should you inflict this punishment on him another day.'

Year 9 pupil Jack, who had his haircut last Saturday, arrived at St Ambrose Barlow from St George's High School in September following the closure of the high school in Walkden. Ms Brown says he was never in trouble for his hairstyle at St George's. Headteacher Marie Garside declined to comment on the matter other than to say: 'Parents are aware of the school rules before pupils start in September.' According to government guidelines, every school has a behaviour policy which sets out the conduct for pupils before and after school as well as during the school day. Scools can punish pupils if they behave badly with measures including a routine 'telling-off', a letter home, detention or confiscating something considered inapporpriate for school. But it can also include removing a pupil from a class or group. Parents have the right to complain about a punishment and must first contact the headteacher. If they are not satisfied, they can ask for a copy of the school's complaints procedure.",

Members of the caribinieri outside their Palermo HQ Tuesday following raids against Sicilian mafia suspects. More than 1,200 Italian carabinieri, backed by helicopters, took part in the operation and arrested 89 suspects, added Colonel Teo Luzzi, the head of the carabinieri in the regional capital Palermo. The operation began at 3:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. ET Monday) and was still going on at midmorning. Palermo officials said charges would include association with the mafia, extortion, and arms and drug trafficking. \"Their aim was to reconstitute the Sicilian mafia's decision-making body, known as the \"commissione,\" which was disbanded in the early 1990s following the arrest of the top boss Toto Riina,\" Luzzi said. The commissione was the executive body of the mafia, uniting the most powerful bosses of the mafia clans operating in Sicily. It was the commissione that decided to carry out the killings of Italy's top anti-mafia magistrates in May and July 1992. The high-profile killings prompted the Italian government to deploy the army in Sicily to fight the mafia, and Toto Riina was arrested in January 2003. \"Since then the mafia didn't really have a decision making body,\" Luzzi said, \"and with these arrests we decapitated the top brass of the Palermo mafia.\" Luzzi also said that Sicily's most wanted Mafioso, Matteo Messina Denaro -- who has been on the run for more than a decade and leads a clan in nearby Trapani in western Sicily -- is not among those arrested. \"But those whom we did apprehend were associated with him and were trying to create a new decision-making body at his request,\" Luzzi said. Arrest warrants were also issued against several suspects in Tuscany, Luzzi said.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Internet giant Google has been stopped from gathering images in Greek cities for its Street View service until it provides further guarantees about privacy. One of Google's Street View camera cars capturing images in central London. Launched in the U.S. two years ago, Street View provides users with access to 3-D \"pedestrian's-eye\" views of urban areas by zooming into the lowest level on its Google Maps and Google Earth applications. It has since been rolled out in more than 100 cities in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, Britain and the Netherlands. The images are obtained from cars specially-fitted with cameras that drive around towns and cities taking panoramic 360 degree shots of everything from pedestrians in the street, to customers sitting in street cafes. Despite pledging to recognize local privacy laws, Google has come under fire from privacy campaigners who fear the application could be abused by criminals or even snooping government agencies. Do you agree? Share your thoughts below . In April, a group of villagers in a picturesque English village chased away one of the search engine's camera cars as it attempted to photograph their homes. Fearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the Web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets, villagers in Broughton, north of London, summoned the police after blocking the car. A month earlier, the BBC reported that Google was forced to pull a number of images from Street View after receiving complaints about pictures that included a man entering a London sex shop, and a drunken reveler being sick at a bus stop. The search giant has now run into trouble in Greece after being blocked by the country's privacy watchdog from expanding its service there. The Hellenic Data Protection Authority wants further clarification from Google about how long it will store images for and the measures in place to make people aware of privacy rights. In a statement, a Google spokesperson told CNN: \"Street View has not been banned in Greece. We have received a request for further information from the Greek DPA and we are happy to continue discussing these issues with them and provide information they request. \"Google takes privacy very seriously, and that's why we have put in place a number of features, including the blurring of faces and license plates, to ensure that Street View will respect local norms when it launches in Greece. \"We believe that launching Street View in Greece will offer enormous benefits to both Greek users and the people elsewhere who are interested in taking a virtual tour of some of its many tourist attractions.\"",

        "article": "By . Kate Lyons . Malcom Turnbull and Alan Jones exchanged fiery words on radio this morning, when the broadcaster told the federal communications minister that he had 'no hope ever' of becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. Mr Turnbull and Mr Jones were involved in a heated exchange, which resulted in the minister telling the radio personality that he was a 'bomb thrower' who could dish it out but couldn't take it. The interview started by Mr Jones telling Mr Turnbull to 'say after me' that he supported the controversial budget, announced last month. Scroll down for video . 'I am not going to take dictation from you': Alan Jones started his interview by trying to make Malcolm Turnbull repeat after him that he supported the government's budget . The controversial radio host told the federal communications minister that he was causing problems in the Liberal Party by meeting with Clive Palmer . 'Alan, I am not going to take dictation from you, I am a cabinet minister,' said Mr Turnbull. Though Mr Turnbull went on to say that he 'unreservedly' supported the budget. AJ: Malcolm, I've coached Australia in rugby. If one of my players on the eve of the rugby test was seen socialising, having dinner, privately inviting a member of the All Blacks, on the eve of a test match, the player would be sent home, Malcolm. MT: Well, this is not football. We are not playing football.MT: Yourself, Andrew Bolt in particular, have set out to suggest there is dissension in the government, that there are challenges to his leadership \u2013 . AJ: No there's no challenge to his leadership\u2026 precisely because you have no hope, ever, of being the leader. You've got to get that into your head. No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to chuck a few bombs around to blow up Abbott a bit, that's what they're saying. MT:\u00a0 This is the most united, cohesive government we've had in this country for a long time and I think it's just very sad that you and Bolt are doing the work of the Labor Party in undermining the Abbott government. AJ: Oh, so we're the bomb throwers? MT: You are, Alan, you are. AJ: I see. MT: Let's assume [Palmer] is standing in the way of our budget repair\u2026 Do you think the best way to get him out of the way, Alan, is to abuse him in the sort of language you're abusing me with? AJ: I'm not abusing you. MT: [laughs] Oh really? I don't think any of your listeners would be under that misapprehension. AJ: You've got a few sensitive nerves there Malcolm! MT: Alan, the problem with you is that you like dishing it out but you don't like taking it. Mr Jones then turned the conversation to Liberal leadership speculation. Rumours have intensified this week that Mr Turnbull, who lost the leadership of the Liberal Party to Tony Abbott in 2009, might be making a tilt for the top job after he ate dinner with Clive Palmer and was vocally supportive of the ABC. 'You have no hope ever of being the leader, you have got to get that into your head,' said Mr Jones.\u00a0 dd . 'No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to chuck a few bombs around that might blow up Abbott a bit. That's what they're saying.' Mr Turnbull responded by saying he was 'distressed' that conservative commentators such as Mr Jones and Andrew Bolt had suggested there was division in the Liberal Party and that he and Prime Minister Tony Abbott were a team. This is the second stoush Mr Turnbull has engaged in with conservative press this week. Earlier in the week he responded heatedly to an article from Andrew Bolt, which accused Mr Turnbull of trying to destabilise Tony Abbott in a bid to become leader of the party. Mr Turnbull's frontbench colleagues have come to his defence. In response to a question in parliament after Bolt's column was published, about whether Mr Abbott would support his 'friend' Andrew Bolt or his 'frenemy' Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott replied: 'In any dispute between a member of my frontbench and a member of the fourth estate I am firmly on the side of my frontbencher.' Treasurer Joe Hockey defended Mr Turnbull on Thursday after the interview with Alan Jones. 'Malcolm is putting in a huge effort as we all are in endeavouring to focus on the policies of the budget rather than the politics,' Mr Hockey told Sky News. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he believed Mr Turnbull doth protest too much', and there was clearly division in the Liberal Party. Mr Turnbull (pictured today) has been accused by conservative commentators of destabilising the government .",

        "article": "Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's support from voters has plummeted and he is now as unpopular as Julia Gillard ever was, a new poll has revealed just days after his government delivered a harsh first budget. This comes as Mr Abbott launched a stunning riposte in defence of the budget on Sunday, saying 'selective hearing' from the electorate was to blame for any confusion over the cost-cutting package. Labor has been boosted to a 12 percentage point lead over the Coalition in the two-party vote at 56/44, the monthly Fairfax-Nielsen nationwide phone poll showed on Monday. Mr Abbott says he has delivered a budget in line with Australians' expectations, despite 75% of people polled by Galaxy claiming they will be worse off . Mr Abbott's negative rating has also hit minus 28 per cent, which is as low as any number former Prime Minister Ms Gillard recorded at her most unpopular. Labor leader Bill Shorten has also jumped to an 11 point advantage as preferred prime minister over Tony Abbott for the first time ever, leading 51 per cent to 40. Since Treasurer Joe Hockey delivered the budget on Tuesday, the Abbott Government has been fending off accusations they broke election promises. Mr Abbott spent Sunday again defending the budget, which includes a Medicare co-payment, pension cuts and a fuel excise rise. In one interview the Prime Minister admitted his first budget included 'increased taxes' and in another he pointed to selective listening for confusion about election promises. 'Well, I know that people hear different things,' Mr Abbott told ABC's Insiders TV program. Mr Abbott's negative rating has hit minus 28 per cent, which is as low as any number recorded by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard (pictured in September 2013) Meanwhile Labor is using the Budget as chance to show a united front. At the annual Australian Labor Party Conference in Melbourne, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told members the budget had brought Labor together. 'This terrible budget of the Abbott Government, it has defined the Labor party,' he said on Sunday. 'Friends, the Labor Party nationally has its voice back.' Labor will oppose doctor co-payments, a raised pension age, restrictions on unemployment benefits, cuts to state funding and the fuel excise. Also on Mr Shorten's hit list is Mr Abbott's 'juvenile' paid parental scheme. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and his party will oppose key measures of the budget, including the doctor co-payment and pension cuts . The Opposition Leader claims millionaires will have an extra $50,000 in their pockets they don't need. 'See how that goes for pensioners trying to get an extra smear of vegemite on their toast on day 13 of their budget,' Mr Shorten said. Labor are joined by The Greens and Palmer United Party who are also opposing several measures. It means Mr Abbott will have to push hard to win Senate support for the harshest of his budget measures. The Labor party are not the only one opposing the new cuts and payments. The Greens and the Palmer United Party are also opposed to the measures . Mr Shorten went on further to say the Government was using the state's cuts to schools and hospitals funding as a smokescreen to hit taxpayers with another tax. 'They are actually increasing taxes through the back door,' he told Labor members. Mr Shorten said the states had no other choice but to raise the GST to recover the lost funding. Labor\u00a0have labelled it blackmail as well as the Greens. Tony Abbott says everyone needs to help pay down the nation's $667 billion debt . But Mr Abbott said it was about ending handouts the Government could not afford. 'What I've got to do is ensure that at the Commonwealth level, we are not living beyond our means, we're not mortgaging our future and piling up never-ending debt for our children and grandchildren,' he told Fairfax radio. While Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten gave their two cents, state and territory leaders gathered at an emergency meeting in Sydney to discuss the $80 billion hole left in state funding due to cuts in Tuesday's budget. But the states quashed any chance of a GST or income tax hike - it was something else on their minds. Following Labor's lead, the leaders took a united front and called for an urgent Council of Australian Governments meeting prior to July 1. Tony Abbott said no election promises were broken when Joe Hockey (pcitured) handed down his budget . And they aren't the only ones feeling the pinch. Sunday's latest Galaxy poll, published by News Corporation, showed 75 per cent of people thought they would be worse off because of the budget. And thousands of protesters who rallied in capital cities reflected that position. But Mr Abbott continues to insist that the budget was in line with what his government promised, including stopping the boats, cutting the carbon tax, funding better roads and getting the balance sheets under control. 'I don't want to plead the fine print but I do believe that we have fundamentally kept faith with people,' he said. Mr Abbott said everyone had to share the burden caused by Labor 'spending like a drunken sailor'. But the Prime Minister did not renew threats to hold a double-dissolution election over the budget, saying the crossbenchers would understand the harsher measures.",

The 46-year-old Northern Irishman, who played in five Ryder Cups and was a vice-captain in 2010 and 2012, was chosen ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn by a five-man selection panel at Wentworth. Clarke said: 'I am naturally extremely proud to be selected as European Ryder Cup captain for 2016. The Ryder Cup has been a massive part of my life and my career, so to have the chance to lead Europe next year is a huge honour.

'I am lucky to have played and worked under some fantastic captains in my seven Ryder Cups to date and I look forward to the challenge of trying to follow in their footsteps and help Europe to a fourth consecutive victory at Hazeltine next year.' The selection panel consisted of the three most recent captains - Paul McGinley, Jose Maria Olazabal and Colin Montgomerie - along with European Tour chief executive George O'Grady and players' representative David Howell. McGinley and Clarke's relationship has been severely strained since Clarke put himself forward for the 2014 captaincy, having previously sent McGinley a letter supporting the Dubliner's candidacy. And when Tom Watson was named US captain in December 2012, Clarke suggested 2010 captain Montgomerie should also be considered as 'whoever it is standing on that stage opposite Tom Watson needs a huge presence'. Clarke was vice-captain at the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor in Wales .

With the support of star players such as Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter it was McGinley who eventually won the day, and he insisted after leading Europe to victory at Gleneagles last year that he would not let personal feelings affect his view on his successor. Clarke has also stated he would be 'foolish' not to immediately seek McGinley's advice if given the daunting job of following in his footsteps. The last of Clarke's five appearances as a player was an emotionally-charged occasion at the K Club in 2006, when he somehow won all three of his matches just weeks after the death of his first wife Heather from cancer. Clarke and long-time friend Lee Westwood played the final fourball match of the first session against Phil Mickelson and Chris Di Marco, with Clarke hitting his opening drive more than 300 yards down the fairway and then holing from 12 feet for birdie.

Last year, Apple revealed it was working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone. Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them. Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Japanese electronic messages and webpages, whose use is spreading outside Japan. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means \"picture\" (e) + \"letter\" (moji). Icons are standardised, and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese curry, and sushi. Some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could noww be added. Because Emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium. The disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue. Apple's Katie Cotton, who was the head of communications at the firm at the time, replied, telling MTV: 'Tim forwarded your email to me. We agree with you. 'Our emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms. 'There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard.' The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard. 'Of the more than 800 Emoji, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says. 'There's a white boy, girl, man, woman, elderly man, elderly woman, blonde boy, blonde girl and, we're pretty sure, [video game character] Princess Peach.' A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard. 'But when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys, there's a staggering lack of minority representation.' It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones.

        "article": "A stray Tabby who was rescued last week has given birth to 11 kittens just days before Christmas. Donatella gave birth to the large brood yesterday, less than one week after arriving at her new home at the Cats Protection's adoption centre in Bridgend, South Wales. One of Donatella's kittens was stillborn but vets say the remaining ten newborns are in good health following their mother's five-hour labour. Tabby Donatella gave birth to 11 kittens at the Cats Protection's adoption centre in Bridgend, South Wales . The adorable kittens were born after Donatella went through a five-hour labour yesterday . Donatella, thought to be aged one, was handed into the charity last week after a householder who had been feeding the cat noticed she was heavily pregnant. Vets say it was lucky Donatella was handed in when she was, in time for the gruelling labour. Cats Protection's Clinical Veterinary Officer Beth Skillings said: 'The large litter is in itself unusual, but for so many to survive the birth is exceptional. 'Late pregnancy is very draining even for cats in good health, so for an underweight stray like Donatella it would have been particularly gruelling. 'First time mums usually have smaller litters, so it's possible Donatella may already have had a litter, despite being so young herself. 'It's hard not to find Donatella's story heart-warming, especially at this time of year. One of the kittens was stillborn but ten of the kittens are all in good health after the five-hour long labour . Donatella, believed to be aged one, was handed into the charity one week earlier, after a householder who had been feeding her noticed she was heavily pregnant . 'But it's important to remember this is not a fairytale - Donatella was a stray who has been through quite an ordeal to carry and give birth to so many kittens.

        "article": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In January 2010 a seven-point magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti, killing more than 250,000 people and damaging its infrastructure, including some water systems. Even before the quake, Haiti's water systems were fragile, and just months after the quake the country was hit with a devastating cholera outbreak -- the first in nearly a century. By the time the outbreak subsided, more than 8,000 people had died and hundreds of thousands more had become sick. Independent studies suggest the outbreak was caused by U.N. peacekeepers who improperly disposed of fecal matter that ended up in Haiti's Artibonite River, a main tributary, where people bathe. In its own report, the U.N. concluded that the outbreak was \"the result of bacteria introduced into Haiti as a result of human activity\" -- but the organization says water and sanitation and healthcare system deficiencies allowed the bacteria to spread. \"A cholera patient excretes the cholera bacteria in huge numbers and, if that excreta gets into the water or the food supply and other people consume it, they too will become ill and they'll amplify that by contaminating more water and more food,\" explains Dr. Eric Mintz, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. \"That's where you see these incredibly rapid epidemics of cholera, and that tells you that the water is unsafe.\" Today, Haiti's Mirebalais University Hospital is training new doctors for another cholera outbreak. \"That could happen again, particularly in parts of the country where people have not had a lot of cholera,\" says Mintz. \"They may not have the experience to recognize it. They may not know what to do in terms of treatment. We certainly can't stop now and declare victory.\" Watch the video above to find out more.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- On Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, a line of 26 black crosses stand in the sand, with the Stars and Stripes behind them and a pot of flowers alongside. They are the tribute of the group Rio de Paz -- River of Peace -- to the victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School, from a group that knows all too well what tragedies gun violence can inflict on society. Brazil, Norway, Britain, France and Australia are among many countries that have seen terrible episodes of gun violence in recent years. But alongside the many expressions of sympathy and condolences that have poured into Newtown, Connecticut, from around the world, there is also a sense of bewilderment that such tragedies happen on an almost routine basis in America. \"Routine\" may seem an exaggerated or callous description, but it was President Barack Obama who said at an interfaith service Sunday night in Newtown: \"We can't accept events like this as routine.\" Strangers inspired to honor Newtown victims . Even so, commentaries from abroad often include a sense of resignation that not much can or will be done to prevent such atrocities in the future. John Cassidy, who is British and blogs for The New Yorker, writes of driving to his hometown of Leeds in northern England, as he heard the news of the killings at Sandy Hook. \"Nowhere have mass shootings been as prevalent as the United States, and nowhere has the policy reaction been so pathetic,\" he wrote this weekend. Brian Masters, writing in the UK's Daily Telegraph, agreed. \"No American politician will have the nerve to propose the only cure to this repetitive insanity, which would be a sensible, mature and responsible attitude towards the ownership and use of guns,\" he predicted. In the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, commentator Tzipi Shmilovitz was more brutal. \"America is not ready to talk about how it is easier to get a handgun than it is to see a doctor, not ready to speak about the video games that have extreme violence. It is just willing to sweep up everything under the carpet of tears.\" And over at Haaretz, one of Israel's leading commentators, Chemi Shalev, lamented a \"combustible mix of angry American young men, often disturbed and usually white, spurred on by the pervasive and always growing presence of limitless violence in popular American culture, together with the easy-access, open market of guns and ammo, which together produce these shooting slaughters with such sickening regularity. ... \"And if you pour in the often gruesome violence so rampant in the computer and video games that so many American boys are weaned on and addicted to, it should come as no surprise, perhaps, that not only are the most evil and inhuman of mass murders possible, they may soon become commonplace,\" he added. Such observations are not new. Five years ago Chris Lockwood, U.S. editor of The Economist wrote in the Los Angeles Times: \"We might be a little surprised that a country with all the ingenuity and energy that America has seems simply to throw up its hands when it comes to guns, and in effect declares that the homicide rate and regular appalling school massacres, are insolvable problems.\" Obama has now suggested otherwise -- broadening his existing support for a ban on assault weapons. \"We can't tolerate this anymore; these tragedies must end,\" he said Sunday. \"We will be told that the causes are complex and that is true. No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil and prevent acts of violence, but that can't be an excuse for inaction,\" he continued. Dunblane: How UK school massacre led to tighter gun control . Commentators and academics from other countries who have looked at this \"inaction\" in America often raise the following points. The polarization in U.S. politics means that on the really difficult issues, paralysis is more likely than progress. The power of lobbying interests -- and in the case of guns that means the National Rifle Association -- contributes to that paralysis, they say. They also assert that the U.S. Constitution and its political culture protects individual liberty -- or license -- to a much greater degree than is the case almost anywhere else. That includes allowing the ownership of powerful firearms capable of killing dozens within a minute. Sixteen years ago, both Australia and the United Kingdom saw gun rampages similar to those at Virginia Tech, the Sikh temple in Wisconsin, the theater in Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook. More: How other countries have dealt with massacres . In the town of Dunblane, Scotland, 16 children and one adult were shot dead at an elementary school in 1996. The gunman then shot himself. The atrocity led to revisions to the Firearms Act that in effect banned the possession of handguns in Britain. Jack Straw, the minister who pushed the legislation through Parliament, said after the Sandy Hook killings that he would \"not put money\" on U.S. laws changing. In a BBC interview, Straw added: \"I think sensible people want it to happen, but the National Rifle Association, which is this extraordinary gun lobby and gun manufacturers' lobby, controls politics in a number of states.\" One tweet put it more bluntly: \"Dunblane,1996. 16 dead kids+adult. 1.2 million sign petitions. UK govt. enacts new law. Halts private guns. Tag, USA. You're It.\" In that same year, a 28-year old Australian killed 35 people with two semiautomatic rifles in just eight minutes. Then-Prime Minister John Howard pushed through a law that banned assault weapons and instituted a gun buy-back policy. (Some 650,000 were taken out of circulation.) Howard recalls telling an audience in Texas in 2008 that the law was among his proudest achievements in 12 years as prime minister. \"There was an audible gasp of amazement,\" he wrote in an op-ed this year in The Sydney Morning Herald. After the mass shooting in Aurora this year, Howard said he was not optimistic it would change anything. \"The responses of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney ... were as predictable as they were disappointing,\" he said. \"There are many American traits which we Australians could well emulate to our great benefit. But when it comes to guns we have been right to take a radically different path,\" Howard concluded. Australian-born media magnate Rupert Murdoch chimed in Saturday on his Twitter account: \"When will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons? As in Oz after similar tragedy.\" Some columnists don't detect any popular pressure in the United States for change, even if the gun control debate has flared in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. Mirjam Remie, who writes for the Dutch newspaper Handelsblad, observes that \"support for stricter gun laws has been steadily declining for decades. According to Gallup, it is 44%, but twelve years ago it was 66%.\" Debate rages about the relationship between the availability of guns in society and the number of deaths caused by guns. But the laws enacted in the UK and Australia sharply restricting gun ownership do appear to have made a difference. A study (PDF) by researchers at Harvard University in 2011 found that in the 18 years before the new law was enacted in Australia, a total of 13 gun attacks had led to four or more fatalities. In the 16 years since the new law, the number was zero. Individual homicides involving guns have also fallen. Japan has some of the most restrictive regulations in the world on gun ownership. Shotgun licenses for hunting require a lengthy application; handguns are forbidden. Homicides by gunfire in Japan rarely get into double figures in a year. In the view of author David Kopel, who has studied Japan's gun control laws in great detail, its regulations work because they are \"part of a vast mosaic of social control ... a pervasive cultural theme that the individual is subordinate to society and to the government.\" That would not be acceptable in the United States. Even so, while recognizing the power of the Second Amendment, foreign commentators are not shy of recommending what could and should be done to tackle gun violence in the U.S. In the UK, The Guardian editorialized in the wake of the Newtown shootings: \"A proper federal system of regulation, including background checks registration, and limits on the type and number of weapons an individual can own, would bring the U.S. belatedly into line with other civilized countries, as would a determined push back against state legislation allowing the carrying of concealed weapons in public.\" Hours before the Sandy Hook massacre, Michigan lawmakers passed legislation allowing those with concealed pistol licenses to carry guns into schools, hospitals and churches among other places. In the words of one commentator: \"No society that holds itself up as an example to the world should, as the United States does, brazenly shrug off what are clearly deep national character flaws when it comes to our love of guns or our celebration of hate politics.\" The writer was not a foreigner, but an American -- David Rothkopf -- writing in Foreign Policy. And he was writing not this weekend, but after Jared Loughner shot and killed six people, and injured more than a dozen, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in January 2011.",

        "article": "A Pennsylvania town near the woods where police are still searching for alleged cop killer Eric Frein has canceled Halloween because of the massive manhunt. The Barrett Township said its annual Halloween parade - the town's biggest event of the year - and 5K Scarecrow Race will be canceled indefinitely and trick-or-treating is banned this year. Some residents of the Pocono Mountains town said they fear that if Halloween goes ahead, Frein could escape with the help of a costume, WNEP reported. It comes as the search for the self-described survivalist, who is believed to be hiding out in the woods near to the town, reaches its fourth week. Scroll down for video . Where is he? Police released these digitally-enhanced pictures of Eric Frein to show what he might look like a month after he shot a trooper. He is hiding out in a wooded area, causing a nearby town to cancel Halloween . Frein has eluded authorities since he shot dead Corporal Bryon K Dickson II, 38, as he stepped outside during a shift change on September 12. Trooper Alex T Douglass, 31, was critically wounded. Local residents expressed their disappointment that the events had been canceled, while others said they are more fearful in their hometown. 'This parade is probably one of the biggest events that the town has every year,' Ralph Megliola, chairman of the township's Board of Supervisors, told ABC News. 'Everyone looks forward to the parade. Myself and my family personally have been away and cut our vacation short to get home in time for the parade. Thousands of people line the streets.' The parade, which would have been the town's 50th, should have fallen on October 26. Search: Officers are searching the wooded area next to Barrett Township, which has canceled Halloween . Relentless: A FBI agent looks out over a bridge on Thursday in Henryville, Pennsylvania during the search . If he is found before Halloween, the town will reconsider its Halloween activities, Megliola said. 'It's taking a toll on everybody,' Barrett Township Police Chief Steven Williams told WNEP of the search. 'It's taking a toll on the police department. It's taking a toll on the public.' The search is also affecting tourism to the area thanks to road blocks and hunting restrictions. Residents reported seeing scores of police cars along the roads and helicopters flying above. Throughout their search, the survivalist has left police clues. Most recently, Frein's journal was found ditched at a campsite near his home in Canadensis. In the diary, he wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on the Pennsylvania State Police barracks. 'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads. 'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that. Gunned down:\u00a0Corporal Bryon K Dickson II, 38, (left) was allegedly killed by Frein on September 12, while Trooper Alex T Douglass, 31, (right) suffered a critical injury when he ran to Dickson's aid . Hunt: An FBI agent searches a creek bed on Thursday. Authorities say they spotted Frein earlier this week . 'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. I ran back to the Jeep.' The diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper or that he was intending to target any  individual. Instead, in sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder. Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been looking for Frein ever since. The most recent sighting came on Tuesday afternoon, when an officer thought he spotted a brief glimpse of Frein from about 200 yards away, State police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens said. That was the fourth sighting by police or the community since Friday, he said. 'We will get Frein. Whether that is today, whether that is tomorrow or whether that is next week, remains to be seen,' Bivens said.",

When Daphne Carroll agreed to laser facial treatment, she was only hoping to remove a spider vein on her cheek. Instead, she was badly burned by the procedure at a medspa - a business that is part cosmetic surgery clinic and part day spa.

Before: This is Daphne Carroll before she underwent 'laser facial' treatment at a medspa in Tennessee to have a spider vein on her cheek treated . After: Mrs Carroll endured swelling, second-degree burns and permanent nerve damage as a result of the surgery . She told ABC News that after countless visits to neurologists, dermatologists and plastic surgeons, she has come to grips with the fact that the damage is permanent. 'I describe it as - if you hit your thumb with a hammer and you feel that throbbing. It's that through my cheeks,' the 42-year-old Mrs Carroll told WZTV in Nashville. The damage has also has also impaired the La Vergne, Tennessee, woman's eyesight - making it difficult for her to drive. She called the side effects of the procedure 'the most horrible experience of my life.' Mrs Carroll said she was approached by staff at a medspa in 2007 when she went in to buy makeup. They called the procedure a 'laser facial.' Mrs Carroll said she never realized that it was actually surgery performed with a powerful laser. 'All possible side effects were downplayed, and the consent form did not say surgery,' Mrs Carroll told ABC.

She later learned that the physician supervising the procedure was an OB-GYN, not a certified plastic surgeon, she alleges.

Instead, she awoke with horrific second-degree burns to her face, swelling and shooting pain. The disfiguring burns eventually healed, but the pain and numbness in her face remains.

The wife of a drugs 'Mr Big' who fled Britain after killing a primary school teacher in a road crash has finally been brought to justice, police said. Paula Barnes, 45, of of Baydon, Wiltshire, fled to Holland more than two years ago after being charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

With her honey-streaked blonde locks, unlined skin and sweet smile, Sheri Winkelmann, an actress and playwright, looks years younger than her real age of 51. But it's possible that her preternaturally youthful looks are the result not of good skincare but the famous maxim: 'you're only as old as the man you feel'. And for Sheri, that means very young indeed. Her boyfriend of just over a year, up-and-coming actor Desmond Huey, is just 26 years old. Scroll down for video . Happy couple: 'Cougar' Sheri Winkelmann, 51, with Desmond Huey, 26, her boyfriend of just over a year . Now the couple are to appear on TLC documentary, Extreme Cougar Wives, which explores what life is like when your other half is young enough to be your son. And for Sheri, life with Desmond is so good, she wouldn't change a single thing. 'It's been about 15 months and it's going good,' she says of her relationship. 'He's a very unusual young man and he's very mature for his age. I feel I have a trusted equal partner and he's never ever done anything to drive me up the wall!' Wonderful though her other half is, she admits there have been moments where others haven't been quite so understanding. 'I do wonder whether people are reacting to the age difference or the fact that we're black and white,' she muses. Perfect match: Sheri says shared values and Desmond's maturity are the secret of their relationship . Open-minded: Sheri says women should be more accepting of love that comes in an unconventional package . 'But there has been no real opposition. Perhaps it would be an issue if we were living in an all-white town in the countryside but here in Chicago, people are more open minded.' The couple, who first met more than two years ago at a conference in Palm Springs, were friends for 12 months before Desmond finally made his move. 'I think it [the relationship] works because of our shared value system,' she explains. 'Obviously having children is a big issue but he's not ready so not an issue yet. 'What's different is that we really love each other in the purest sense, so we will do what's best for each other even if that means not being together.' Despite acknowledging the potential pitfalls, Sheri thinks its time women stopped fixating on age and opened themselves up to relationships with men they might not have considered. Confidence: According to Sheri, in order to catch your own dream man, feeling happy with yourself is key . 'I never like to be limited by a label,' she explains. 'Cougar doesn't necessarily have the most positive connotations but people should open up to love, . and if comes in form of someone younger, then don't dismiss it. 'Before meeting Desmond, I had . rejected the idea of dating someone younger but he just wore me down. 'I would tell other women to . trust their insticts and go with the flow - love comes in all kinds of odd packages.' Sheri and Desmond appear in Extreme Cougar Wives on TLC, Tuesdays at 10pm .

        "article": "(CNN) -- Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic have often been talked about this year as being part of the next generation of players who can break up the dominance of tennis' Big Four. But judging by his display at the U.S. Open, Marin Cilic could be the most likely candidate. Cilic became only the third men's player outside Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray to win a grand slam title since early 2005 when he crushed Kei Nishikori 6-3 6-3 6-3 in under two hours in New York on Monday. Few, however, would have seen it coming -- last year the 25-year-old Croatian didn't play at the season's final major because he was serving a drug suspension. Cilic felt aggrieved when he received his nine-month ban after testing positive for a banned stimulant he said got into his system accidentally. It was later reduced to four months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled that the initial punishment handed out by the International Tennis Federation was too severe. He returned late last year with extra gusto -- and a serve made even better by his charismatic coach, countryman and idol, Goran Ivanisevic. Ivanisevic himself was one of the biggest servers in the history of the men's game. \"In this last year my team has brought something special to me, especially Goran,\" Cilic, who pocketed $3 million, told the crowd. \"We're working really hard, but most important of all the things he brought to me was enjoying tennis and always having fun. \"I think I enjoyed my best tennis over here and I played the best ever in my life. \"One of the biggest pieces of advice Goran gave me this tournament was to not think too much,\" he later told Britain's Sky Sports. \"Toss the ball, hit it, play your game, be aggressive. Try to be relaxed.\" The 6-foot-6 Cilic overpowered Federer in the semifinals in straight sets and did the same against the diminutive Nishikori, firing 17 aces and winning 80% of his first-serve points. In the sixth game of the second set, Cilic hit four straight aces to hold to love. And when it wasn't his thunderous serve, it was his heavy ground strokes that pinned back his Japanese opponent. While Ivanisevic won Wimbledon in 2001 to send his nation into a frenzy, Nishikori was bidding to become the first Asian man to claim a grand slam singles title. Back at home ahead of the finale, excitement soared to unprecedented levels after Nishikori upset Djokovic in the semifinals. Replicas of his shirt were sold out, his racket was in high demand and television viewers bought subscriptions in vast numbers to watch the final against Cilic that began at 6 a.m. in Tokyo. Alas, they were disappointed. But the 24-year-old Nishikori still made history by becoming the first Asian man to play in a grand slam singles final. Remarkably, he didn't know if he would be able to compete in New York this year because he had surgery to remove a cyst from his toe a month ago and missed warmup tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati. \"He was playing really well today and I couldn't play my tennis,\" Nishikori told the crowd. \"It's a really tough loss but I'm happy to come into the final. \"It was a fun two weeks.\" Monday marked the first occasion since the 2005 French Open that two players in their maiden grand slam final faced off, leading Ivanisevic to proclaim beforehand that Cilic and Nishikori would be nervous. Both began the tournament outside the top 10, though they're now in it. \"They are both climbing to Mount Everest,\" Ivanisevic told Sky Sports. \"I don't know who is going to stick the flag, (a) Japanese or Croatian.\" Cilic, though, seemed relaxed from the outset. He smiled as he walked in the tunnel that led to the biggest court in tennis, during the coin toss and when he took part in the pre-match photo. It turns out he was bluffing. \"The night before I was completely relaxed,\" said Cilic. \"I was feeling that it's just another match, another day. But a couple of hours before the match the nerves started to kick in and I was a bit nervous. \"I didn't know what to expect on the court.\" Cilic -- who entered the encounter with a 2-5 record against Nishikori -- nonetheless set the tone by saving a break point in the first game with a fine running forehand cross court. Whether it was nerves or the different conditions -- it was cooler and slower than when he downed Djokovic -- Nishikori often mistimed his shots in the first set. He showed his frustration at 2-4 after he struck a short ball that allowed Cilic to pounce with a forehand. Nishikori never did turn things around, finishing with 19 winners and 30 unforced errors. Cilic was broken for the only time as he attempted to close out the second set but then broke straight back to take a two-set lead. Nishikori engineered five-set magic against Raonic and Stan Wawrinka in the fourth round and quarterfinals, respectively, but there would be no stretching Cilic to five sets. Wawrinka beat Nadal to win the Australian Open in January, although the Spaniard was severely hampered by a bad back. Another break handed Cilic the lead in the third set and when he fended off three break points in the seventh game, the match was essentially over. After double faulting on a first match point -- he tried to finish matters in style with a second-serve ace -- there was no mistaking on the second match point. Cilic ripped a backhand cross-court that gave Nishikori no chance and he collapsed to the court before making his way up to his player box to celebrate. The celebrations will intensify when he returns to Croatia. \"Everybody from home was telling me it was a huge day for Croatia,\" Cilic said. \"Everybody was stuck to the TVs.\" A continuation of this form and Cilic can expect to be celebrating much more in the future.",
        "summary": "(CNN) -- Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic have often been talked about this year as being part of the next generation of players who can break up the dominance of tennis' Big Four. Cilic became only the third men's player outside Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray to win a grand slam title since early 2005 when he crushed Kei Nishikori 6-3 6-3 6-3 in under two hours in New York on Monday. One of the biggest pieces of advice Goran gave me this tournament was to not think too much,\" he later told Britain's Sky Sports. \" He was playing really well today and I couldn't play my tennis,\" Nishikori told the crowd. \" He smiled as he walked in the tunnel that led to the biggest court in tennis, during the coin toss and when he took part in the pre-match photo.

        "article": "Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes striker Diego Costa can now put his injury problems behind him and will be back in prime condition when the Premier League resumes after the international break. The Spain international has been plagued by hamstring and pelvic injuries since joining from Atletico Madrid for \u00a332million but that has not stopped him scoring 10 goals already, including the winner in the 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Saturday. Costa has been left out of the national squad for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus next week and a friendly against Germany three days later. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is delighted striker Diego Costa is being rested by the Spain national team . Costa scored the winner in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League on Saturday . Costa has been troubled with a hamstring problem all season, but Mourinho feels the rest will be a big help . By the time the league campaign resumes at home to West Brom on November 22, Mourinho expects his star man to be firing on all cylinders. 'I think Spain made a fantastic decision not just for us but for them,' he said. 'He has 15 days to get to the top of his game and when they need him they will get a good Diego not a bad one. 'Maybe the injury was good because it stopped him. When he became injured he had time to recover, step-by-step, and at this moment he is in a good condition.' Mourinho also hopes the international break will give midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Ramires time to recover from hamstring and abductor problems respectively after risking them at Anfield. 'I need to give credit to them - they both played injured, risked everything to play,' he added. Mourinho said Ramires (left) and Cesc Fabregas (right) both played against Liverpool with injuries . 'Fabregas gambled and I gambled. He can join up with Spain but he will be back (as he is not fit).' Unbeaten Chelsea maintained their four-point lead at the top of the table with a ninth win in 11 matches and stretched a remarkable 15 points ahead of Liverpool, runners-up last season. The Reds were not realistically expected to contend this campaign but even without them in the running, Mourinho knows there is plenty to be done before his team can even entertain thoughts of the title. 'If this was the Spanish, Portuguese or German league where you have two teams competing to be champion, if you leave one team 15 points behind you are almost there but this is England and every match is difficult,' he added. 'It is not about Liverpool, there is Man City, Arsenal, Tottenham, Southampton. 'We are in a good situation, we have already played the four matches in Liverpool and Manchester, four very difficult matches away, but it is the beginning of November so there is a long way to go.' Emre Can (above) put Liverpool 1-0 up against Chelsea with his first goal for the club in the ninth minute . Gary Cahill (above) equalised five minutes later with a goal that needed confirming through goal-line technology . If Chelsea have a long way to go, Liverpool's task is even more onerous as a fifth defeat of the season - and third in a week after reverses at Newcastle and Real Madrid - leaves manager Brendan Rodgers with some difficult questions to ask himself and his players. The decision to rest key players in Madrid, making seven changes, did not pay off in terms of a result against Chelsea. 'Obviously there is pressure on when you don't get the result but I can only refocus now and it is important we get back to winning ways after the international break,' said the Reds boss. 'It is a difficult moment for us as we're not getting the results and it has been a tough week really. 'Our focus is getting into that top four with the considerable change we have and we still have a big possibility to do that.' Brendan Rodgers looks on as his Liverpool team lose for the third time in their last three games . With little goal threat to trouble the leaders, the return of striker Daniel Sturridge, who has not been seen in a red shirt since August 31 because of thigh and calf injuries, cannot come soon enough. He is expected to be ready for the trip to Crystal Palace on November 23. 'The break comes at a good time for us. We are hoping to get one or two injuries back after that and then we have to look to get on a run,' added Rodgers. 'It has been a long time now (without Sturridge). We are hoping he can now get to work because he hasn't trained with the team at all in the time off. Daniel Sturridge missed Saturday's game through injury and Rodgers hopes his return will improve Liverpool . 'Hopefully over the course of the next couple of weeks he can be out there training and we will have him back, which will be important as he has had a big impact for us.' Emre Can's first goal for the club since his \u00a310million summer move from Bayer Leverkusen gave Liverpool the ideal start - with the aid of a huge deflection off Gary Cahill but the Chelsea defender got himself back in credit by bundling the ball over at a corner for the equaliser, which required the assistance of the goal decision system. Costa displayed his clinical best with a sweet first-time strike to drill home Cesar Azpilicueta's cross, although Liverpool had a fair shout for a penalty ignored late on when the ball appeared to strike Cahill's arm.",

UPDATED: . 03:09 EST, 1 April 2013 . After two initial replays, CBS stopped showing footage Sunday of Louisville basketball player Kevin Ware breaking his leg during the first half of his team's NCAA men's tournament game against Duke. The injury during the nationally televised game, and the shocked reaction of Ware's fellow players, called to mind the gruesome broken leg suffered by Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann in a Monday Night football game in 1985. During Sunday's game, Theismann tweeted his best wishes to Ware. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Kevin Ware, 20, screams with pain as trainers cover his leg following a crippling injury Sunday night during the Louiseville-Duke game . Inspiration: Despite unimaginable pain, Ware reportedly told teammates not to worry about him and to focus on winning the game . Ware had leaped to try and block a shot by Duke's Tyler Thornton. His leg landed awkwardly, buckled and flopped as he fell to the ground. The first hint that the injury was out of the ordinary came from Thornton, who put his hands to his face and had an anguished look as he ran back on defense. CBS commentator Clark Kellogg described the injury was \u2018gruesome.\u2019 \u2018If you can bear to watch it, take a look but it's a gruesome-looking injury,\u2019 Kellogg said. CBS showed the replay twice in slow motion, although not with a close-up of Ware landing. The network also never showed a close-up of the injury. CBS then concentrated on reaction shots. Three of Ware's teammates were on the ground near the basket. Wayne Blackshear cried, Chane Behanan knelt on his hands and knees and Peyton Silva sat, a hand covering his mouth. The network aired a close-up of medical officials working on Ware, showing the player only from the face up. Hurt: Ware, 20, is comforted by teammate Luke Hancock after the horrific injury. He was quickly loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital . Even Rick Pitino, the hardened coach of the Louisville Cardinals, fought back tears as his player was carted away from the court . CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus said that because of the graphic nature of the injury, the network decided not to show it after the original replays. People could quickly find replays on YouTube, anyway. \u2018We did not zoom in on the injury when he was taken off,\u2019 McManus said. \u2018We did not try to highlight it. I think we did the right thing.\u2019 At halftime, Greg Gumbel noted that CBS would not show the injury. Its highlight package again focused on the reactions, including Louisville coach Rick Pitino wiping away tears. Pitino answered questions from CBS during the game about Ware, noting the injured player was exhorting his teammates to win the regional final. A Louisville spokesman said Ware was \"resting comfortably\" at Indianapolis' Methodist Hospital. As is often the case, the coverage quickly became a hot topic on Twitter. Sports writer Jason Whitlock tweeted that \u2018CBS handled this curveball (Ware injury) masterfully.\u2019 The network's decision to stop showing the replay only goes so far. Right after the game ended, the CBS affiliate in Phoenix aired the footage of Ware being injured in a local sports report. Coverage of the injury represented the second difficult call of the day for CBS. Earlier, the network cut away from the dramatic conclusion of the Sony Open men's final, switching to the tipoff of the NCAA tournament game between Michigan and Florida. The network did alert viewers that if the third set between Andy Murray and David Ferrer went to a tiebreaker, it would switch coverage of the Tennis Channel. Sickened: Ware's teammates sobbed on the court after seeing their friend so badly injured during the game . Emotional: Despite being devastated by Ware's injury, the Cardinals took charge of the game during the second half, leading Duke by more than ten points .",

Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson has lost out to his arch-rivals in a battle over air routes to Russia. But watchdogs say passengers will benefit through cheaper and more 'dynamic' fares and that British Airways and easyJet's plans were 'likely to deliver the greatest benefit to consumers'. The tycoon learned tonight that his airline Virgin Atlantic had been rejected by aviation regulators in a fight to operate UK to Moscow flights. Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson lost out to British Airways in a battle over air routes to Russia . With more flights now available between the UK and Russia, British Airways, easyJet and Virgin had been vying for the right to fly on the London-Moscow route. The Civil Aviation Authority ruled that BA, which already operates to Moscow, and easyJet should be allowed to take up the Moscow flights - meaning that Virgin had missed out. The decision follows the Department for Transport ruling in August that FirstGroup rather than Virgin Rail should take up a new 13-year franchise on the West Coast Main Line. Sir Richard launched a legal challengers against the ruling and the DfT has now scrapped the West Coast bidding process, suspended three civil servants and asked Virgin to carry on for the time being. The CAA's two-from-three decision came after what is known as a scarce capacity hearing at which a panel of CAA board members considered the arguments put forward by each of the applicant airlines. The panel decided to allow BA to continue to operate the services it currently operates from London Heathrow to Moscow's Domodedovo Airport and to grant easyJet permission to operate between London Gatwick and Moscow Domodedovo. With more flights now available between the UK and Russia, British Airways, easyJet and Virgin had been vying for the right to fly on the London-Moscow route . The Civil Aviation Authority ruled that BA, which already operates to Moscow, and easyJet should be allowed to take up the Moscow flights . Iain Osborne, the CAA's director of regulatory policy, and chairman of the panel, said: 'On balance, allocating scarce capacity to BA and easyJet is likely to deliver the greatest benefit to consumers. 'EasyJet's proposal will introduce an innovative product into the market and has the potential to deliver the greatest dynamic fare benefits for consumers.' He added: 'We concluded that easyJet's proposal would introduce a distinctly different product into the market and would stimulate innovation on the route as a whole, as well as satisfying and stimulating consumer demand that is currently under-served, in particular, people who prefer or are content to use Gatwick.' The CAA said easyJet was expected to begin operating services to Moscow from early 2013. The CAA understands that BA will continue with its current schedule. EasyJet said it would operate an Airbus A320 on two services a day between Gatwick and Moscow. Each aircraft will have 180 seats and the airline expects to fly more than 230,000 passengers in its first year of operations. EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said: 'We are delighted to have been awarded the rights to fly between Gatwick and Moscow. 'We believe this is the right decision for consumers both in the UK and Russia.' A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: 'We are very disappointed with the result of the CAA hearing which we believe flies in the face of what the consumer wants and our economy demands. 'Data shows that passengers travelling between Moscow and London want to use Heathrow airport and not Gatwick, long haul connectivity is far greater via Heathrow and this decision will also reduce capacity between the two capitals.' 'We are perplexed by what we consider a very short-sighted decision. We will review the CAA's report in full before considering all of our options.'",

        "article": "(CNN)It started with a sore throat on Thanksgiving and an antibiotic from a friend who wanted to help. Now 19-year-old Yaasmeen Castanada is fighting for her life inside a California hospital's burn unit, suffering from an allergic reaction that's so severe she has large open wounds all over her body. \"It is heartbreaking, every day is a different look. Every day, she's like, shedding away. ... Overnight, it's a whole different person that you're looking at,\" Martha Hughes, Castanada's aunt, told CNN affiliate KABC. Doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a rare disease that can be triggered by antibiotics or other medications. \"When she took the medication, she started having a hard time breathing, and she told her mom that her lips were burning, her throat, her eyes, they got so red that she couldn't talk. So she rushed her to the ER, and that's when they diagnosed her with the disease. And from there it has just spiraled to a nightmare,\" Hughes said. Now Castanada, the mother of a 4-month-old, is in critical condition at the University of California, Irvine, burn center. Her prognosis is good, even though the disease has a high mortality rate, according to Dr. Victor Joe, the center's director. But the situation, Castanada's family says, has been devastating. \"Just unreal, just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally, burn in front of you,\" her mother, Laura Corona, told KABC. \"Every day, a new blister, a new burn, a new scar. And she's just, 'Mommy, I want to go home.' And I can't take her home. I can't put water on her lips.\" Mom: 'Don't share medication' On a website created to raise funds for Castanada's care, her mother said the harrowing ordeal began soon after her daughter took the medicine. \"A  friend offered her an antibiotic pill that she had from a previous illness,\" Corona wrote. \"She was thinking that it would help her. This would be the biggest mistake of her life.\" Now, Corona says she's hoping to spread the word so others don't make the same mistake. \"Don't share medication. Don't give someone else your medication. Don't offer medication,\" she said. She also advises parents to find out what their children are allergic to -- before it's too late. Doctor: Reaction causing skin to separate . At first, doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, which refers to a condition where between 10% and 30% of the skin on the body is affected, Joe said. Now she's experiencing Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, the diagnosis when more than 30% of the body is affected. Joe estimates that 65% of Castaneda's skin and mucus membranes have been affected. The allergic reaction is causing layers of Castaneda's skin to separate, Joe said, creating lesions that grow into large open wounds. \"Patients can experience problems with taste, swallowing, eyesight and sexual functions can be affected. In Yaasmeen's case, we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected. This can cause scarring of the corneas, which could lead to permanent blindness,\" he said. \"We are trying to prevent that from happening.\" Photos on the fundraising website show Castanada lying in a hospital bed, with openings for her eyes cut from the bandages that cover her. As part of her treatment for the disease, doctors have wrapped her body in a special dressing, Joe said. \"We have chosen to place a dressing that adheres to the open wound, which allows her skin to heal without having to remove the bandages to wash the wounds,\" he said. Mortality for those suffering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis can be as high as 25% in adults, but tends to be lower with early treatment, according to the Merck Manual. Though it's uncommon, Joe said his hospital has treated around six cases in the past year, because the burn center has experience treating open wounds. \"This is very sobering. The fact that you can get a life-threatening situation from taking a medication.  It can happen, and most people don't think twice about taking pills for things,\" Joe said. \"In fact, most of the time you do have some sort of side reaction to medication, just not this severe.\" After recovering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, patients usually only have minor issues with their skin, such as dryness, Joe said. \"Hopefully new skin will come in,\" Corona told KABC. \"I'm just there watching. All I can tell her is, \"Hang on, hang on. It's almost over.'\" CNN's Joseph Netto and Deborah Goldschmidt contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Roger Federer had a 10-minute row with rival Stan Wawrinka after Federer's wife 'heckled' him from the sidelines during their match. Federer won the match 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 at the O2 in London on Saturday but his victory has been overshadowed by the fallout. It is understood that\u00a0one of the reasons the Swiss compatriots fell out at their ATP Tour Finals semi-final was because Federer's wife Mirka heckled Wawrinka. Stan Wawrinka (left) and Roger Federer pose together before their ATP World Tour Finals semi-final at the O2 . Wawrinka trained in Lille ahead of next weekend's Davis Cup final, where he will play alongside Federer . The Swiss No 2 sweeps the court after the session, but the controversy has overshadowed his preparation . Neither Federer or Wawrinka has responded to the spat yet, although they are expected to play together . Wawrinka, arriving in Lille, will be key if Federer is to pick up the last title he has not yet earned in his career . Federer announced his withdrawal from the ATP World Tour Finals on Sunday after arguing with Wawrinka . Federer's wife Mirka is alleged to have questioned whether Wawrinka could beat her husband in the semis . Wawrinka was left unhappy after overhearing comments from Federer's wife Mirka on Saturday night . Federer (second left) poses with his first Wimbledon trophy in 2003 alongside then-girlfriend Mirka (right) Born in Bojnice, Czechoslovakia in 1978, Mirka Vavrinec began her own tennis career at a young age and turned professional when she was 20. She won three ITF titles during her career and reached a highest ranking of No 76 in the world in September 2001, but a persistent foot injury forced her to quit the game a year later. She met Federer at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and married him in 2009. The couple have two sets of twins - identical twin girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva (born July 23, 2009) and twin boys Leo and Lennart (born May 6, 2014). As well as looking after her children, Mirka often follows her husband on tour and is said to be a major factor in the huge success he has experienced over the last 11 years. In an interview with Inside Tennis earlier this year, Federer said of his wife: 'I think every wife is important. Mine is no different. She's [always] been involved to some degree, but [she was more] involved, midway through our relationship. She came to every practice, every match, spent breakfast, lunch, and dinner together for years. 'It's still very intense today, but we have kids and she's seen 900 matches, I guess. She's OK missing one once in a while and not coming to practices any more. She's been very important in my life, not just as a tennis player, but overall.' Among Wawrinka's complaints is that she made audible comments from his supporters' box \u2013 which is at ground level \u2013 questioning in French whether he would have the guts to close the match. According to several eyewitnesses, a vociferous argument developed between the pair in the backstage area. Tour officials decided that the best thing was to push them alone into a private room that had been converted into a gym area, as there is no communal locker room at the arena. While the dispute is not believed to have become physical, a heated 10-minute row ensued in which both aired their grievances against the other. In what had been an unusually feisty and high quality semi-final, Wawrinka had four match points and served for the match at 5-4. According to French television, Wawrinka was picked up saying: 'She did the same thing at Wimbledon.' John McEnroe spoke of the dispute on American television, but he seemed unaware of the extent to which it has escalated, according to those\u00a0Sportsmail\u00a0has spoken to. Another cause of tension in matches between the two is said to be the presence in Federer's box of Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi, who coaches the world No 2 along with Stefan Edberg. Although doing his best to stay impartial in these encounters, it is not hard to see why Wawrinka might resent his team competition captain siding with his rival when it comes to their head-to-head combat. Ultimately the Swiss No 2 was unable to finish the job off and was denied a place in the final of the prestigious year-end championships, with well-placed sources saying he was furious at the intervention of Mrs Federer.

The three-day team event, which begins on Friday, could see the pair joining forces in a doubles match at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille. Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lammer are the other members of the Switzerland team. There was no comment from the Federer camp on Monday morning, but the situation is especially delicate because on Friday the two men, who have got on well in the past, are playing for Switzerland in the Davis Cup final against France. It is the only major prize in tennis to have eluded the 17-time Grand Slam champion, and he will be relying on his long-time colleague to help him achieve that last ambition, particularly if they are paired together for a doubles match. They were leaving for Lille on Monday morning where the match will be played inside the city's football stadium. While the undoubted row between the two men is a distraction, it was not the main cause of Federer pulling out of Sunday night's final, although the tension it caused is unlikely to have helped. The Swiss master, drained by the physically and mentally exhausting match against Wawrinka, sustained a pull in his back and clearly did not wish to risk it ahead of the Davis Cup final. Federer usually manages to avoid controversy and his wife says little in public, despite playing a major role in her 33 year-old husband's phenomenal career.

Federer, pictured with Mirka at the Laureus World Sports Awards, says his wife has seen over 900 matches .

A former player herself, when she was known as Miroslava Vavrinec, she reached a career high singles ranking of 76 and met the soon-to-be superstar at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, she had to retire from the sport with a persistent foot injury and has since channelled her energies into helping her husband become the global icon that he now is. Aside from maintaining his fitness and training regime and having four young children, Federer also has a large portfolio of sponsorships and has his own personal charitable foundation that he attends to. Mirka, who married him in 2009, is said to be a key component in making his life run like a Swiss clock to keep the success going. She is also known to have steely side, and it seems that is what has led to the fallout with Wawrinka that could be a threat to Switzerland's Davis Cup dreams.

        "article": "Stop me if you've heard this one before. A TV series based on a comic book series premieres Friday. There have been a lot of them lately, from \"Gotham\" to \"The Flash\" (and of course the ratings juggernaut \"The Walking Dead\"). They've done quite well this season: Both \"Gotham\" and \"Flash\" received full-season pickups. NBC's new offering, \"Constantine,\" is a riskier proposition. It's based on the story of cult character John Constantine, the chain-smoking exorcist antihero from the \"Hellblazer\" comic books. Keanu Reeves played him in a 2005 film version, which got a lukewarm reception. Even so, the show seems well-suited to NBC's Friday night horror lineup, following the sleeper hit \"Grimm.\" CNN visited the Atlanta set of \"Constantine\" and spoke with Constantine himself, Matt Ryan, as well as his co-star Charlie Halford (who plays one of John's sidekicks, Chas), and later spoke to executive producer Daniel Cerone. The set itself included a cobweb-filled library that serves as John's base of operations. Watching a contortionist portray a demon-possessed woman seemed to be just another day at the office here. In between scenes, we asked their thoughts on whether the show had what it takes to be another comics-based hit. CNN: Do you think the hardcore fans will enjoy this series? Matt Ryan: I think the fans will get a lot out of this series. I hope they will. The source material is so amazing. We're really trying to stay true to that. We're transposing it to this medium of television. We're staying true to this character in the comics. The fans will hopefully come with us, and new fans will like the show as will. Daniel Cerone: The fans are very important to us. I'm fortunate enough to have as my partner David Goyer, who has brought comic books to life in films. We are fans of the property; it's a property that David loves and wanted to bring to screen. For us, it's a dream come true. It would never occur to us to be anything less than loyal to the fans. CNN: Do you understand why fans would be nervous? Charlie Halford: I totally understand that. I like to think that we're stepping up to the plate, at least with this show. The greatest compliment we can hope to receive is the blessing of die-hard \"Hellblazer\" fans. Everyone involved with the show have become relatively big fans of the comic book. You keep wanting to read one story then the next and the next. I asked the writers, what's the \"bible\" for this show? They said, \"It's the 'Hellblazer' comic.\" I took great confidence in that. Ryan: A very good friend of mine has his own comic book company, and for years, he's been telling me about John Constantine being his favorite comic book character and \"Hellblazer\" his favorite book. Ever since I got the part, he keeps sending me emails: \"Why don't you do this storyline or that storyline?\" It's like I've got my own personalized fan who's feeding me all the great things about the character. I didn't know that much about it until I delved about the comics, and the more I'm reading, the more I'm loving. CNN: Compared with \"The Walking Dead,\" for example, how much of the show is directly from the comic? Halford: You've got 350 issues of a comic book that ran for almost 30 years. If we ever needed a storyline, they just go right back to the comic books. With some of these episodes we've been shooting recently, it's as though these characters walked right off the page. Hopefully, that resonates with the fans. Cerone: Our perceived story arc is based on his first appearance in \"Swamp Thing.\" They were facing this menace called the \"rising darkness,\" a force trying to create this climate of fear across the world, to enable a large evil to be born into the world. That arc from \"Swamp Thing\" is exactly what we're bringing to \"Constantine.\" Week to week, we have to find our own stories. Sometimes they're from the comics, sometimes not. Ryan: To be honest, I've tried to absorb the comics and let that influence me. You have to stay true to the essence of it, but you have to give it your take as well. The most important thing for me was, what is John about? It's just trying to find that and how I connect to that. There's bits of me in there as well and fleshing it out as well. Cerone: It's a little bit easier for us, since we're not a show about superheroes, and John Constantine doesn't have superpowers. In a way, we're more of a horror show than a comic-book show. For us, as a horror show, it might be easier than other straight comic-book adaptations. For us, the draw of the show was the character himself. John Constantine is a character we haven't seen on television. He isn't afraid to thumb his nose at any form of evil. He's just a really fun, inventive character. His costume is a trench coat and a skinny tie. He fits our reality. CNN: \"Hellblazer\" was definitely a book for mature audiences. What can you get away with at 10 p.m. on a Friday on network TV? Cerone: We're always trying to find that balance. To NBC's credit, more often than not, we'll turn in a script or a cut of an episode, and NBC will say, \"Take it further; make it more extreme.\" They'll push us to make it darker. They understand the way people watch television, at least for this kind of show. David Goyer and myself are censoring ourselves with what you can and can't do on television, and it's NBC that's telling us to take it further.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Jay Leno took one for the team, in the form of a $15 million pay cut, to protect the staff of NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" from further cuts. An NBC Universal representative confirmed Friday that the host took a 50% pay reduction. The representative also confirmed that Leno extended his contract until September 2014. A source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN last month that 20 to 25 employees of \"The Tonight Show\" were let go and that Leno made the salary concession to prevent even more staff reductions. According to the source, the layoffs were part of a plan to adjust the show's expenses to be more in line with typical late-night programming as opposed to prime-time fare. Leno replaced the legendary Johnny Carson as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in 1992, a job he held for 17 years before he left in 2009 to helm \"The Jay Leno Show\" with a 10 p.m. start time. But a few months later, in January 2010, NBC announced that the comedian would return to the 11:35 p.m. time slot. The comic's venture into prime time three years ago was pitched as an attempt by the network to parlay his proven popularity into a commercially successful show. But lagging ratings prompted NBC executives to change course within a few months. That move ultimately led to fellow talk show host Conan O'Brien's departure from the network. O'Brien, who had taken over \"The Tonight Show,\" now hosts the show \"Conan\" on TBS, which, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner. Leno jokes about 'Tonight Show' layoffs .

A mother and her three children are fighting for their lives today after her jilted former-boyfriend set himself on fire during a row at their family home. The 30-year-old, is believed to have doused himself with petrol and turned himself into a human torch after apparently turning up at the home of 40-year old Tracy Jones in the early hours of this morning. As he went up in flames, Tracy and eldest daughter Cailin, 18, tried to put out the fire but the blaze ripped through the ground floor of the family\u2019s \u00a3120,000 semi detached house in Altrincham, Greater Manchester. Fighting for their lives: Tracy Jones, left, and her daughter Cailin. Ms Jones's deranged former lover is believed to have doused himself with petrol and turned himself into a human torch at their home . Neighbours managed to pull Tracy from the house after college student Cailin staggered outside and cried for help. Firefighters stormed inside the property and carried out Tracy\u2019s sons Shaun, 15, and Zach, aged four who had been asleep in bed. The unnamed boyfriend, 30, was rushed to hospital with horrific burns but died later of his injuries. Today, Tracy, a typist and here three children were all said to be a critical condition with burns and smoke inhalation. The tragedy occurred at 5am this morning after the boyfriend - who was believed to have been dating Tracy turned up at the house. The pair were believed to have been talking in the living room when suddenly fire broke out. In hospital: Two of Tracy Jones children Zach and Cailin. Cailin, 18, tried to put out the fire as it ripped through their home . Neighbour Kevin Pearce, 41, a supermarket worker said: 'I woke up from hearing screaming and smashing glass. Firefighters stormed inside the property and carried out Tracy's sons Shaun, 15, pictured, and Zach, aged four, who had been asleep in bed . 'I looked out my bedroom window, saw smoke and I told my partner to call the fire brigade. I dashed out of the house as fast as I could and I could see the daughter was already on the grass outside. 'The front door was locked but the downstairs window was open and I managed to pull the window off the hinges. I could see Tracy and I managed to tug her through the window frame. 'She was conscious but in obvious . shock and was screaming and hysterical. I wasn\u2019t thinking anything about . my own safety - it was pure adrenalin was driving me to get her out. 'I . got the mum out and ran around the back and that\u2019s where the older son . was, but that was locked, so I pulled the back window off but the smoke . was too much. 'Then the . emergency services came and I told them that someone was in the kitchen . and the little lad was upstairs in his bedroom. It\u2019s such a tragedy. This is a quiet neighbourhood and they were a lovely family who always said hello.' Another . neighbour Bernadette Fleming, a cleaner, 55, said: 'I woke up to hear . Tracy screaming through the window: \"my baby, my baby.\" I thought I was . dreaming at first then Iooked out to see all hell breaking loose. 'I will never forget those terrible . screams. I was only speaking to Tracy last week. I went down to the gate . and I could see all this smoke. It shook me up a hell of a lot. None of . us knows who the dead man is. We didn\u2019t even know Tracy had a . boyfriend.' Phil . Berkovitch, 59, a gas engineer said: 'We do each other favours. She was . only here the other week because her phone wasn\u2019t working so we are more . than just neighbours, we\u2019re friends. They are a close-knit family and . very friendly. Fire, police and forensic officers search for clues following the blaze in the early hours of this morning. Tracy Jones jilted lover died after setting fire to himself . 'I saw the fire, we heard a commotion and came rushing out just as the fire engine came up. By that time the fire was downstairs. I\u2019m not too sure if they were all out at that time. We knew that Kevin had pulled Tracy out. 'The little lad was carried out by the fire brigade and Tracy was hysterical. She got carried off strapped into a chair. 'Kevin did great a job in getting her out. If he wasn\u2019t there, she might not have been able to get out. You never think that this is going to happen.

In fact, it's the eighth annual 'Mormon Prom' in Morristown, New Jersey, a night of modesty at a decorated basketball court at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Nearly 300 students aged between 16 and 18 gathered at the hall on Saturday - some traveling from outside states to attend - for a night of good clean fun. Good clean fun: Teenagers maintain a respectable distance as they dance during a Mormon prom at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Morristown, New Jersey on Saturday night . Date night: Richard Murray, 18, and Allison Garner, 18, share a dance at the prom, which is open to all teens . The event, . which started after local teens complained about lewd behavior at their . schools' proms, was open to students of any religious affiliation, not . just Mormons. But all had to abide by its rules - no drinking, inappropriate clothing or alcohol. 'There is no pressure to do anything . immodest or reckless, like party or drink afterwards,' Anna Jensen, . a Mormon who attended the dance with two Catholic friends, told the New Jersey Star-Ledger. 'The music was . clean and the dancing was also clean. Overall, it was just a group of . kids, Mormon or not Mormon, that wanted to enjoy themselves without . being influenced by what our modern society believes to be the norm.' The students were encouraged to skip the usual pricey practices, such as buying new dresses or arriving in a limousine, and most were taken by their parents, who then socialized together in a separate room. Alternative night: Students are dropped off by their parents, instead of taking extravagant limousines . Cheese! Cassie Marriott, 16, and Jed Fuller, who traveled from Connecticut, pose for a photo at the prom . Some . students like Anna and junior Matt Norton said they would also be going . to their school's prom, while others attended instead of their school's . event. 'I'm going to my school prom in May,' Norton, a fellow Mormon who attends Morristown High School said. 'The types of dancing and music will be very different. It will be more inappropriate at the school prom.' And he added: 'Girls still look good in modest dresses.' The prom began eight years ago when students complained to their parents about their high school dances, the Star-Ledge explained. Respectable distance: Mckenzie Alvarez, 16, and Joe Cicon, 16, share a dance at the Mormon prom - an event that began 8 years ago when teens complained about their lewd school dances . Getting to know each other: Justin Lippert, 18, and Jennifer Dulin, 18, talk at one of the prom tables. All students at the dance must abide by its rules to keep a distance and avoid short skirts and alcohol . Two local Latter-day youth leaders, Cindy Manchester from Pompton Plains and Heidi Elton from Short Hills, joined together to address the concerns their daughters and other students had with their school dances, including steep prices and immodest clothes. They approached their church leaders and their plan was approved, with the first prom being held in 2006. Mormon churches across New Jersey sponsor the prom.",

        "article": "By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . A third year of drought in California has meant farmers have become increasingly\u00a0 dependent on ground water for their crops - and now the land is sinking beneath their feet. A USGS study found that land sinking had been measured at nearly one-foot per year in one area in the San Joaqin Valley, and that it is reducing the flow capacity of the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct, two key sources of water. Increased pumping of groundwater is damaging vital water infrastructure, the U.S. Geological Survey says. No end: Houseboats and boat docks on Digger Bay Marina in Shasta Lake City, California on 24 July 2014. Water levels show below the reddish banks which is 41 meters (135 ft) from crest and 36 per cent of capacity as California goes through its third straight year of dry weather . Sinking feeling: Visitors take photographs at the bottom of Folsom Lake, which is 17 per cent of its capacity, in Folsom, California . 'We were surprised at the amount of land being affected,' Michelle Sneed, a USGS hydrologist and the report's lead author. 'We were also surprised by the rapid rate of (sinking).' Case Vlot, a farmer who uses groundwater to keep his crops of corn and alfalfa alive says the ground at his Central Valley farm is sinking between six and eight inches a year. Chase Hurley runs a water company nearby that sells river water to farmers who don't have groundwater to depends on. Now, reports SF Gate, Vlot's underground wells are collapsing and the dam Hurley depends on has sunk so far that the river is threatening to spill over. The two, along with other California farmers, are trying to brainstorm ways to curb the heavy reliance on groundwater and that resulting damage. Farmer Case Vlot stands in a dry river bed that has sunk due to subsidence . And farms aren't the only ones suffering from the sinking land. Railways, roads and pipelines - things that extend over a long distance - are also under threat from an increase in the rate of ground sinking, Sneed said. For California's bullet train project, which would speed through the Central Valley, the sinking ground is being taken into account for the system's design, Frank Vacca, the chief program manager for the California High Speed Rail Authority. He said the rail system will be made of a flexible material that can give into movement. Huntington Lake, California: An observation deck over the lake is left high and dry as the water level in Huntington Lake is only a third full . Crisis: Cattle graze before near the California Aqueduct on grassland that remains dry and brown at the height of the rainy season . 'This is just one more box to check on our list of engineering considerations,' Vacca said. Woodley said the issue has already affected construction projects on the massive San Joaquin River restoration, already projected to cost $1 billion. The issue of sinking land in the San Joaquin Valley is not new, but had slowed in recent decades after the construction of the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal. But the sinking problem in the two years studied 2008-2010 was exacerbated by drought, the report found. In those dry years, there was less rain, but also limits placed by water regulators on surface water use. This caused farmers and others to increase the amount of water pumped from underground; there are no restrictions on groundwater pumping in California.",

Rosberg was fastest all weekend \u2013 in three practice sessions and the first two periods of qualifying. And, when it counted, he pipped Hamilton by three hundredths of a second with a nerveless final act in cloudy Sao Paulo. His time of 1min 10.023sec eclipsed the previous lap best set here by Rubens Barrichello of 1min 10.646sec for Ferrari in 2006.

Rosberg has now taken 10 pole positions to Hamilton\u2019s seven, a remarkable record given that no previous team-mate has outperformed Hamilton, the acknowledged one-lap specialist, in qualifying over a season. \u2018Perfect job if only it were tomorrow,\u2019 said Rosberg. \u2018I am in the best place but I have to make it count, which I didn\u2019t do last time in Austin. I didn\u2019t find my rhythm there but I am confident I can put that right.\u2019 Yes, it is during races that Hamilton has proved the superior performer, having won 10 grands prix to Rosberg\u2019s four. That gives the Briton a 24-point lead going into the penultimate round. Yet double scoring in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight leaves his title hopes vulnerable to a decisive mistake or a calamitous engine failure. Back to Saturday's showing in Brazil, Hamilton explained that he lost a bit of time at turns one and 10 on his final flying lap, but said: \u2018It is a long race and there should be two or three stops. There are opportunities throughout, not just at the start. \u2018The Brazil race means more to me than any other one. It is a race I nearly won in 2012 but I got taken out. I remember watching Ayrton (Senna) race on this track when I was younger, and that makes it special.\u2019 A random factor in this capricious climate is the ever-present danger of rain, and that could yet play havoc with the otherwise unassailable Mercedes of Hamilton and Rosberg. Hamilton made two errors on his final run at turns one and 10 and finished three hundredths adrift of Rosberg . Hamilton is 24 points ahead of Rosberg with two races remaining, but has never tasted victory in Brazil . Someone who knows all about the local weather is Felipe Massa, who was supported warmly en route to an impressive third fastest for Williams. Every time he tore along the pit straight, his countrymen got to their feet, waved their hands in the air and let out a cheer that carried across the track to the media centre over the garages. Jenson Button, who is due to leave McLaren at the end of the season to make way for Fernando Alonso, beat his team-mate Kevin Magnussen and will start fifth, two places ahead of the Dane. Away from Sao Paulo, Caterham are trying to raise enough money to compete in Abu Dhabi. They have launched a \u2018crowdfunding\u2019 scheme by which supporters are urged to contribute a minimum of \u00a310 in exchange for bits of old car. Bernie Ecclestone is unimpressed that Caterham are trying to raise money to compete in Abu Dhabi . Rosberg has now taken 10 pole positions to Mercedes team-mate Hamilton\u2019s seven this season . So far the team, who are administration with debts of \u00a316million, have raised \u00a3500,000 towards a target of \u00a32.35million. Their deadline is next Friday and the clock is ticking loudly. But F1\u2019s puppeteer Bernie Ecclestone is unimpressed by the project. \u2018I think it\u2019s a disaster,\u2019 he said. \u2018We don\u2019t want begging bowls. If people can\u2019t afford to be in Formula One, they have to find something else to do. \u2018If I sit in a poker game and I can\u2019t afford to be there with the other people, I get killed and have to leave. \u2018We give the teams nearly $900million (\u00a3561m) a year. We don\u2019t spend it. \u2018When I had a race team a few years ago, in fact a few hundred years ago, I used to run it according to how much money we could spend and we won the world championship. \u2018That\u2019s what they don\u2019t do. They don\u2019t seem to understand that somebody is going to be last.\u2019 That someone in qualifying was Pastor Maldonado of Lotus. There were no surprises in the eight who fell out of the reckoning with him, leaving the 10 leading lights in the shootout for pole. And, as is his consistent habit, Rosberg shone brightest at the sharp end of Saturday afternoon, at a record average speed of 138.45mph. Williams driver Massa, of Brazil, came third in qualifying behind Rosberg and Hamilton on Saturday .

Yes, it is during races that Hamilton has proved the superior performer, having won 10 grands prix to Rosberg\u2019s four. That gives the Briton a 24-point lead going into the penultimate round.

        "article": "SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- Thousands of protesters demonstrated against China's human rights record and its crackdown in Tibet after the Olympic flame arrived in San Francisco Tuesday. Pro-Tibetan demonstrators shout outside the Chinese consulate in San Francisco Tuesday. Chanting and waving flags, the protesters ended their march at the Chinese consulate, where they sat in a dense group, holding flags and banners, as police watched from nearby. \"Stop killing,\" one sign read, while another said, \"No human rights, no Olympics.\" The protests came after passionate demonstrations in London and Paris in which protesters tried to snuff the torch's flame and dozens were arrested. Meanwhile, the Olympic flame was being kept in an undisclosed location in advance of Wednesday's planed 6-mile relay in San Francisco.  Watch how the city is preparing \u00bb . The run is the only U.S. appearance for the flame, wrapping up the first week of a 23-city global tour. Beijing organizers have said the monthlong international relay will not be stopped despite the protests, but some International Olympic Committee members have suggested an early end should be considered. The IOC's executive board will discuss the torch relay \"in general\" Thursday or Friday, but there is no proposal on the agenda to end the global tour early, IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said.  Watch the flame get the red-carpet treatment \u00bb . The official Beijing Olympics Web site, controlled by the Chinese organizers, gives little indication of any torch relay disruption. It characterizes the demonstrators as \"a small number\" of Tibetan separatists. Beijing blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted in March amid protests for Tibetan independence. China has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the demonstrations, which began peacefully on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising. China's Foreign Ministry Tuesday reacted forcefully to the torch relay protests. \"We express our strong condemnation to the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by Tibetan separatist forces regardless of the Olympic spirit and the law of Britain and France,\" China spokeswoman Jiang Yu said. \"Their despicable activities tarnish the lofty Olympic spirit and challenge all the people loving the Olympic Games around the world.\" The flame will return to China in May to begin a relay through the host nation, ending in Beijing with the August 8 opening of the Olympic Games. One of the San Francisco torchbearers has dropped out of Wednesday's relay because of fears of protests, a torch relay spokesman said. David Perry, spokesman for the San Francisco Olympic Torch Relay, said he did not want to release the name of the person. \"I understand anyone that might feel that they don't want to expose themselves to something more than protest,\" Perry said. On Monday, three protesters scaled San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and raised a large banner. Those who climbed the cables from which the bridge's deck is suspended were members of Students for a Free Tibet, said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang, 22. They unfurled a banner that read: \"One World. One Dream. Free Tibet.\" The three climbers, along with four people on the ground, were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance charges, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing. The Golden Gate Bridge protest came on the same day that thousands of protesters forced an abrupt halt to the flame's passage through Paris after 10 miles of the 17-mile planned route. Some stops were skipped and the flame was transferred from the torch back to the lamp to be carried on a bus several times to avoid protesters. Protesters pierced the thick security bubble surrounding the torchbearers, at times getting their hands on the torch itself. The Paris demonstrations were similar to those Sunday in London, where at least 36 people were arrested, according to London Metropolitan Police. Protesters cited China's actions in Tibet, its policies on the Darfur region of Sudan and the lack of civil rights and freedoms for the Chinese people. But other demonstrators, bearing Chinese flags, turned out in support of the Chinese government, and many others were spectators there just to see the torch. An Olympic committee member suggested Monday that the public relations nightmare that has followed the Olympic flame on its way to the Summer Games in Beijing may make 2008 the last time such an ambitious global torch relay is attempted.  Follow the torch relay itinerary \u00bb . International Olympic Committee member Richard Kevan Gosper, who is also chairman of the IOC's press committee, told reporters he was always opposed to a global tour for the flame. \"I'm a firm believer that we had the right template in the first place, that the torch simply should go from Olympia, Greece, to the host country,\" Gosper said. E-mail to a friend .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- A former Playboy Playmate of the Year remained in custody in Los Angeles, California, Thursday after being arraigned in the alleged shooting of her husband. Victoria Rathgeb, 66, entered a plea of not guilty when she was arraigned on a charge of attempted murder in a courtroom Tuesday. Rathgeb is charged with trying to kill her husband, Bruce Rathgeb, according to a Shiara Davila-Morales, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. Bruce Rathgeb remains hospitalized at Cedars Sinai Hospital. According to the entertainment website, TMZ, the shooting happened at the couple's West Hollywood apartment, and when officers first arrived at the scene Rathgeb allegedly told them that it was a drug dealer who shot her husband. Morales told CNN that Rathgeb is being held in lieu of a $1.5 million bond and has a preliminary hearing on November 1. She was represented by a public defender at the arraignment. If convicted, Rathgeb faces life in prison with the possibility of parole. Los Angeles police confirmed Rathgeb was arrested on October 16 for allegedly shooting her husband, but said they would not comment further because of the ongoing investigation. According to the L.A. Sheriff's Department, Rathgeb is being held at the Century Regional Detention Facility. Rathgeb was Playboy's 1968 Playmate of the Year, under the name Angela Dorian. She also went by the name Victoria Vetri and had a small part in the movie \"Rosemary's Baby.\" Rathgeb also had roles in popular television shows from the 1960s and 1970s such as \"Hogan's Heroes,\" and \"Star Trek.\" Author and Film Historian, Tom Lisanti profiled Rathgeb for his book, \"Glamour Girls of Sixties Hollywood.\" \"Her real name is Victoria Vetri and she went by the stage name, Angela Dorian, and she was actually considered a pretty good actress and got a lot of television roles. Because of her Italian heritage, she played mostly ethnic characters.\" According to Lisanti, Rathgeb's popularity heightened when she played the part of Mia Farrow's neighbor in Roman Polanski's film, \"Rosemary's Baby.\" \"It was Polanski who told her to use her real name and actually had a line in the movie where Mia Farrow says, 'I thought you were Victoria Vetri, the actress,' and it was sort of a joke because, of course she was Victoria Vetri.\" According to Lisanti, the early '60s were a difficult time for actresses because by the middle of the decade studio contracts were collapsing and independent movies like \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"The Graduate\" were starting. \"There was also this introduction of nudity in films that were becoming really popular and these were women, who were raised in the Eisenhower '50s -- so, they lost a lot of roles because they wouldn't go topless. Obviously Victoria wasn't one of those women -- and so she started as a serious actress and then switched to becoming a sex symbol. \"Her biggest role was in a movie called, 'When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,' and she was, like a lot of actresses at that time, trying to emulate Raquel Welch in 'One Million Years B.C.' but she never achieved that level of fame.\" Rathgeb quietly left acting in late 1970s and went back to doing that age old job of out-of-work actresses -- waitressing, he said.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Last week, I joined the board of a new organization to oppose marijuana legalization: Smart Approaches to Marijuana. The group is headed by former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy and includes Kevin Sabet, a veteran of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Obama. The new group rejects the \"war on drugs\" model. It agrees that we don't want to lock people up for casual marijuana use -- or even stigmatize them with an arrest record. But what we do want to do is send a clear message: Marijuana use is a bad choice. There are many excellent reasons to avoid marijuana. Marijuana use damages brain development in young people. Heavy users become socially isolated and perform worse in school and at work. Marijuana smoke harms the lungs. A growing body of evidence suggests that marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms that otherwise would have remained latent. It's possible to imagine a marijuana rule that tries to respond precisely to such risk factors as happen to be known by the current state of science. Such a rule might say: \"You shouldn't use marijuana until you are over 25, or after your brain has ceased to develop, whichever comes first. You shouldn't use marijuana if you are predisposed to certain mental illnesses (most of which we can't yet diagnose in advance). Be aware that about one-sixth of users will become chronically dependent on marijuana, and as a result will suffer a serious degradation of life outcomes. As yet, we have no sure idea at what dosage marijuana will impair your ability to drive safely, or how long the impairment will last. Be as careful as you can, within the limits of our present knowledge!\" Yet as a parent of three, two exiting adolescence and one entering, I've found that the argument that makes the biggest impression is: \"Marijuana is illegal. Stay away.\" I think many other parents have found the same thing. When we write social rules, we always need to consider: Who are we writing rules for? Some people can cope with complexity. Others need clarity. Some people will snap back from an early mistake. Others will never recover. \"Just say no\" is an easy rule to follow. \"It depends on individual risk factors, many of them unknowable in advance\" -- that rule is not so easy. Richard Branson: War on drugs a trillion-dollar failure . Over the past three decades, and in area after area of social life, Americans have replaced simple rules that anybody can follow with complex rules that baffle large numbers of people. Consider, for example, the home mortgage. Once the mortgage was a very simple product. Put 20% down, then sign up for a fixed schedule of payments over the next 30 years. In the space of a single generation, these 30-year fixed-rate amortizing mortgages turned what had been a nation of renters into a nation of homeowners. For more sophisticated buyers, however, the standard mortgage was a big nuisance. For them, bankers developed more flexible products: no money down, no documentation, interest-only, adjustable rate. These products met genuine needs. But as they diffused down-market, they became traps for people who did not understand the risks they were accepting. Consider how we finance higher education. Once, state governments subsidized their universities to offer a low tuition fee to all comers. Fee increases at private universities were constrained by the lower fees at the public institutions: Duke can raise its price only so high above the University of North Carolina. The universities soon realized, however, that by setting their tuition fees low, they were forgoing revenues that might be collected from the most affluent students. Universities rapidly raised their tuition fees, then offered discounts and aid to students in need. Kevin Sabet: Legalize Pot? No, reform laws . But while anybody could understand a $500 per semester tuition bill, the new system of rebates confuses the very people who most need help. A few days before Christmas, Jason DeParle of The New York Times reported a depressing example of the toll modern financial aid exacts upon students from less sophisticated backgrounds. He told the story of three bright girls from poor families who had recently tried -- and failed -- to gain college degrees. One of them was admitted to Emory, a prestigious school with a full-ticket price of $50,000, but one that grants very generous financial aid -- if the student can figure out how to make the financial aid work for her. The trouble was that students who most need aid are often precisely those who have nobody around them who has ever successfully navigated a complicated bureaucratic institution like a university financial aid office. \"Though Emory sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them, along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check,\" DeParle wrote. \"Angelica reported that her mother made $35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent. With her housing costs so high, Emory assumed the family had extra money and assigned ... an income of $51,000. ... (Angelica) discovered what had happened only recently.\" Unable to cope with the school's e-mail system or to decrypt its rules for imputing family income, Angelica finally dropped out of Emory, burdened by $61,000 in student debt. In 1943, Vice President Henry Wallace published a book celebrating the coming \"century of the common man.\" That century did not last very long. We have transitioned instead into the era of the clever man and clever woman. We have revised our institutions, our programs, our rules in ways that offer profitable new chances to those with cultural know-how -- and that inflict disastrous consequences on those who are overwhelmed by a world of ever-more-abundant and ever-more-risky choices. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana . We're not going to uninvent the no-money-down loan. Universities that receive applications from all over the planet cannot finance themselves like an old-fashioned state land-grant college. But we need to recognize that modern life is becoming steadily more dangerous for people prone to make bad choices. At a time when they need more help than ever to climb the ladder, marijuana legalization kicks them back down the ladder. The goal of public policy should not be to punish vulnerable kids for making life-wrecking mistakes. The goal of public policy should be to protect (to the extent we can) the vulnerable from making life-wrecking mistakes in the first place. There's a trade-off, yes, and it takes the form of denying less vulnerable people easy access to a pleasure they believe they can safely use. But they are likely deluding themselves about how well they are managing their drug use. And even if they are not deluded -- if they really are so capable and effective -- then surely they can see that society has already been massively re-engineered for their benefit already. Surely, enough is enough? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.",

I don't want her to risk her life like her dad has for many years.' Mr Aguero and his family run trips along a 4km stretch of river in Costa Rica where thousands of American crocodiles live and breed.

Pride: Mr Aguero says Jimena is proud to tell her friends that he is the Crocodile Man .

'Believe it or not, every crocodile has its own personality,' he added. 'Some are more aggressive then others. 'But to me the more aggressive they are the better, as it makes a better show.' However, it was one of these larger, more aggressive males that almost killed him in an accident five years ago. Friendly: Over the years, Mr Aguero has come to know the crocodiles very well and has given them names based on their characteristics . Instead of taking the raw chicken he was dangling above its mouth the crocodile leapt forward and clamped its jaws onto his arm. 'He dragged me into the water and I had to fight him,' said Mr Aguero, who spent months in hospital recovering. 'After five minutes I found a branch on which I could sit. I put my finger in his eye and he let go. 'That time it worked but let's hope I won't have to do it again. I don't want to have to go back into the water with my hand inside its mouth and 68 teeth and 2000lb of pressure on my arm.'

Safety measures: Mr Aguero tries to steer clear of crocodiles when they are protecting their babies or very hungry as they are more dangerous . No fear: Mr Aguero says that the crocodiles can smell adrenaline if people are scared of them . 'When you look at the crocodiles it's like a cat, like a tiger. They can smell adrenaline if you're scared.' Despite the dangers of her father's job, Jimena shares his interest in the reptiles. 'Crocodiles fascinate my daughter, she is crazy about them,' said Mr Aguero. 'Always when they mention it at school she tells her friends \"my dad is the Crocodile Man\". She is always talking about my work and she's very proud of me.' Risk: Mr Aguero leaves the boat to feed the reptiles from the muddy bank, sometimes sinking up to his knees in the soft sediment - which makes him extra vulnerable .

She said: 'Crocodiles interest me a lot. My dad doesn't like it, he would prefer it if I looked for my own career. 'But to me, giving food to an animal is something very nice and interesting. It's like helping them to eat.' Second nature: Mr Aguero grew up close to the river and has become used to sharing the space with the crocodiles who live there .
