Boehner was one of a dozen children whose father ran a bar in Ohio; Obama was raised by a single mother in Hawaii after his father returned to Africa. Sharing a smoke -- however unwise or un-PC that might sound -- or a drink or a meal every once in a while is just one way to jumpstart a relationship.

Hundreds of thousands of additional units will likely be taken over by the government and become available in the next few years. Right now, millions of families are paying more in rent than the monthly carrying costs of owning a comparable property. As we spell out in our book, \"Moving Working Families Forward,\" the government could create 1 million homeownership vouchers to cover the carrying costs of homes up to the 25th percentile of area home prices. Some renters took classes offered in financial literacy, too. As the project scales up to involve scores of properties, it will create new jobs and training opportunities for underutilized construction workers.",

        "summary": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Negative headlines about drugs and sex abuse charges greatly diminished Michael Jackson's earning potential, an entertainment consultant said. AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson, not their executives, chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray and that they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. Briggs testified that he studied \"Q score\" data for Jackson, the trend of his album sales and his stability to conclude that Jackson had a low chance of earning money from endorsements and sponsorships. Companies would be \"very anxious\" about putting someone with such negative \"likability\" next to their products, he said. Jackson lawyer Brian Panish will have a chance to question Briggs about his conclusions Tuesday.",

No American politician will have the nerve to propose the only cure to this repetitive insanity, which would be a sensible, mature and responsible attitude towards the ownership and use of guns,\" he predicted. America is not ready to talk about how it is easier to get a handgun than it is to see a doctor, not ready to speak about the video games that have extreme violence. Obama has now suggested otherwise -- broadening his existing support for a ban on assault weapons. \" Sixteen years ago, both Australia and the United Kingdom saw gun rampages similar to those at Virginia Tech, the Sikh temple in Wisconsin, the theater in Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook. The atrocity led to revisions to the Firearms Act that in effect banned the possession of handguns in Britain. There was an audible gasp of amazement,\" he wrote in an op-ed this year in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the view of author David Kopel, who has studied Japan's gun control laws in great detail, its regulations work because they are \"part of a vast mosaic of social control ... a pervasive cultural theme that the individual is subordinate to society and to the government.\" Hours before the Sandy Hook massacre, Michigan lawmakers passed legislation allowing those with concealed pistol licenses to carry guns into schools, hospitals and churches among other places.
